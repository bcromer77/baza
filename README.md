# CreatorTorch ðŸš€

If you've ever wondered what creators are actually *saying* â€” not tagging, 
not hashtagging, but really *saying* â€” then you've arrived at the right 
place. This is CreatorTorch: the dashboard for creators who want to work 
smarter, not harder, and brands that want to stop throwing money at fluff.

It listens. It learns. It recommends. All without asking you to read a 
single PDF.

## Why it exists

Because the old way is broken. 
Spreadsheets, middlemen, manual scouting â€” it's all slower than a sloth on 
a Segway. CreatorTorch gives you instant insights into what matters most: 
your audience.

## How it works

- Add a video
- Let it do its thing
- Get insights that actually mean something

Then â€” and hereâ€™s the fun bit â€” act on it. Events, campaigns, brand deals, 
all from your dashboard.

## Built With

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Tailwind CSS
- A lot of sleepless ambition

## Demo

Coming soon, unless you're an investor. In which case, DM us. Youâ€™re on 
the list.

## Run it locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
