Hey everyone, welcome back to the other seabird. I don't really know how to start this episode.
I've actually tried to record this a couple times and couldn't get through it, but I'm going
to try again and let's see how this goes. All right, this episode is a little bit different.
It's not just a topic or something I've researched and want to share with you. It's a very personal
aspect of my life. It's an aspect of my life that I'm still grieving to this day and it's something
I still don't have all the words for. Today, I want to talk about cancer and fertility,
how one stole the other one from me. I want to talk about the impossible choices I had to make
that really didn't feel like choices at all. About the grief that to this day has never really left me,
about the guilt I still carry, not just for myself, but for my husband, for our future,
for the family that we thought we were going to have. Because cancer didn't just take my
health. It took my pregnancy. It took my fertility. It took my future as a mom. And to this day,
I'm still trying to figure out how to live with that. So if you're listening in and if you've
ever lost a child, if your body has taken choices from you, if you've ever wondered what comes
next when the future you imagine disappears overnight, just know that I see you and I'm here for you.
And we're in this together. I hope this episode makes you feel a little bit less alone.
And if you've never experienced a loss like this, I hope that you never do. But hopefully,
this will give you some insight to help out someone who has gone through this. So this all started
when I was three months pregnant. I was in Texas when this all happened. My husband and I were
visiting my family for my dad's 70th birthday. Just days before we had told him that we were
expecting. And then we'd been sitting around the kitchen table, brainstorming baby names. It was
one of those perfectly sweet, simple moments that you don't realize at that time. But when you think
back on it, you wish you could just freeze it and never leave it. We were throwing out names,
laughing at the ones that sounded ridiculous, debating meanings, picturing who she would be.
And then my husband and I heard one that we loved. It met light. And that's exactly what she
was to me. This tiny, bright little spark that had just started to exist. We had a potential name.
This was real. We were going to be parents. And then just days later, everything changed.
It started with awful, debilitating back pain. It was screaming dozing terrible pain that I would
never wish upon anyone. I waited a few hours, but when it was becoming clear that things were
worsening, not getting better. I couldn't even take a single step. We had to call an ambulance
and take me to the ER. The first thing I asked for was an ultrasound. I was in such horrific pain,
but I just needed to know that my baby was okay. And she was. Her little heart was still beating.
I saw it on the ultrasound machine. And I felt this huge sigh of relief. I was thinking, okay,
she's okay. We're okay. Just need to figure out what this pain is. I had no idea that I wasn't
okay at all. They actually discharged me from the ER because they couldn't give me strong pain meds
because I was pregnant and couldn't scan me because I was pregnant. But I had this feeling and I said,
I'm not leaving until I know what's causing this and I pushed for a scan. Shortly after a doctor
came into the room inside, you have met a static cancer. And then several days of full-body scans
and biopsies, they told me, it's breast cancer you have in a torment driven and your pregnancy is
feeling it. One second, I was pregnant and planning for a future as a new mom. And the next,
I was being told, I have terminal cancer and that I had to end my pregnancy to stay alive.
But every day, I continued to be pregnant. I was lighting the cancer on fire. How the hell
even began to process that? To make matters worse, as I said, I was in Texas where you're not
a last day at an abortion, even if you need it to survive. Doctors were telling me, if you don't
terminate this pregnancy immediately, you will die. It's just a matter of time. But the laws
wouldn't let them give me an abortion. Even though my life was at risk, even though every doctor
was telling me that my cancer was spreading every single day, I was pregnant. Even though I had
to terminate my pregnancy to survive, they wouldn't let me. I wasn't allowed to do the one thing
that would save my life. I asked what are my other options. I asked all the questions numerous times
different ways to different doctors. The best answer I got was that if you stay pregnant,
we can try to deliver the baby at 26 weeks, but we think by then the cancer will have spread too far
and it's likely that neither of you will make it. So I had to get discharge from the hospital
and fly back to San Francisco in the middle of all of this chaos thrown at me just to do what I
had to do to stay alive. It was so wild. Being told you have terminal cancer that your pregnancy
is feeding the cancer that you must end it. But instead of getting the help you desperately need,
you're being told to book a plane ticket. Every single second, my body was working against me.
Every day, my hormones were accelerating, fueling the cancer, pushing it further into my body.
They told us that it was only a matter of time before it spread to my vital organs and then
you know how the rest goes. So I got on that plane, terrified, already feeling that my body was
breaking down further, feeling it weaker each moment. But I didn't even make it to the procedure
to end my pregnancy because by the time my landed in San Francisco, my spine had fractured in
three different places. My back was already so weak from the cancer that it literally just broke.
As lying in a hospital bed, I enabled to move screaming and pain. My body literally breaking
apart. And my oncologist frantically urging me, we have to terminate your pregnancy now. We're
writing out of time. But we couldn't, not yet because my body wasn't stable enough. So instead of
going in for the abortion that I didn't want, I was being wheeled into surgery to have my spine
reinforced with some men. So it wouldn't further break or worse go into my spinal cord, which could
have permanently disabled me. And all the while continuously being told by doctors that my body
is producing sky high levels of estrogen, feeling the cancer even more. It was such a wild and
crazy experience. And I remember just laying there and thinking like, how is this my life right now?
Like how is this real? So after the spinal surgery and after I'd stabilized, they were finally able
to give me the abortion. I didn't have time to process any of it because within days of that,
I was thrown into medically induced menopause and started aggressive targeted cancer treatments.
I went from being pregnant and dreaming about my baby to being told I was dying to having my
spine fractured in three places. To having an abortion, I never wanted to never have been okay with.
To being thrown into menopause overnight, to starting cancer treatment, all in the span of days.
I didn't get to grief, I didn't get to process, I didn't get to sit with the fact that I just lost
my child because my body was being thrown from one trauma into the next.
All right, I'm going to switch off this for a little bit and talk about the
after effects this has had on me and my husband and my marriage. Since the day I met my husband,
I knew how deeply he wanted to be a dad. He had lost his own father when he was 11 years old.
And ever since then, being a father wasn't just something he wanted, it was something he
longed for. It was his biggest goal in life. I knew that from the beginning from day one.
And then I became the one that took that from him. I took that dream away from him.
I know people say, you can't think like that. You have to focus on yourself. You're
survive with your health. You didn't have a choice. But that's on how love works because when
you love someone, what they want becomes your mission too. And I knew how much you wanted this,
how much you wanted to be a dad. And in a single moment, it was gone. And I was the one that took
that from him. Deep down, I know that this wasn't my fault. I know that I didn't choose this.
I know that I fought hard for us and for our baby. But knowing that doesn't make it hurt any less.
Because when I look at him, I see the pain in his eyes. And I know exactly what we both lost that
day and forever. So a year after this happens, while I'm on these medically induced
menopause treatments, my doctor has been telling me that they're not permanent. We're not doing
any damage to your eggs. You know, we could possibly get to a point that we could retrieve eggs
later on down the road. And so there was always that hope that I had that, you know, maybe this
is just something temporary that I'm going through and that there would be another ending to this
about getting some eggs out being able to have a child. But it seemed like cancer had one more
thing to take from me. I was actually going to lose my ovaries to making it impossible to ever
have my own biological child. I remember sitting in my oncologist's office thinking, this was just
a normal routine appointment. And then she said to me, your hormone levels are rising again.
I sat there staring at her, not fully understanding. I said to her, but I'm already in menopause.
She said, your body is still producing estrogen. We see this in times when patients are younger,
your body fights so hormone blockers. She said, your cancer is highly hormone driven and we have
to remove your ovaries, just like that. I'd already lost my pregnancy, but at least before there
was still a maybe, a small distant possibility that one day somehow I could have my own genetic
child. But this surgery was going to take that away too. And so we scheduled it. I went into that
operating room knowing that when I woke up, something inside me would be missing.
When I opened my eyes, it was over. No more maybe someday. No more miracles.
People say you can always adopt. There are other ways to become a mom, which I will say is a really
annoying and insensitive thing to say to someone who lost their ability to have their own biological
child. And yes, maybe, but can we just sit in the loss for a second? Because I didn't just lose
getting to be pregnant and getting to carry my child. I lost the whole chance of ever being a mom
to my own biological genetic child. I lost all of it. And I don't know if I'm ever going to be okay
with that. So where does that leave us now? I've probably spent months, years at this point,
researching both adoption and surrogacy. And to be completely honest, I am terrified. Both
of these adoption and surrogacy agencies look at health records. And I've got stage four cancer.
Will they even approve me? Will a birth mom even choose me? And same with surrogacy? Will someone
want to carry a child for someone that has stage four cancer? Not to mention all of this is insanely
expensive and emotionally so complicated at such a roller coaster. And there's so many questions
I go through my mind. Am I going to feel like this baby is mine if I get a donor egg and someone
else carries the baby? Am I always going to feel like something's missing? And honestly, the biggest
fear I have is that what if I go through all of this, either with adoption or surrogacy, fight for a
child and then I don't get to stay in this world? What if I bring them into the world only for them
to grow up without me? Because that is sadly the reality of stage four cancer. I can fight like
hell, I can do everything right, but I don't get guarantees. And I don't want to finally give my
husband a child, make him a father, only for him to raise a child alone. These are the thoughts that
keep me up at night. So I don't have a perfect ending to this episode, there's no resolution,
but I know this, that if you've been through something like this, I want you to know that you're not
alone. Some pain doesn't have answers, some grief doesn't fade, but we keep going because we're
fighters and God has a plan for all of us. Thank you guys for tuning in, I'll see you next time.
