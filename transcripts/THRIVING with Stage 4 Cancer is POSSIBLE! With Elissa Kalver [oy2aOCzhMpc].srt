00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Hi, I'm Bysma, and you're listening to the other seabird, a podcast about all things

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,760
cancer from a stage four breast cancer warrior. We cover health and wellness, mind body and soul.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,440
Plan to leave each episode with hopefully some new insights and inspiration.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,800
Let's get into this week's episode.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,920
Welcome back everyone! Today we are going to be getting the perspective of fellow

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,680
cancer warrior and driver. I'm thrilled to be joined by Alyssa Calver.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,280
Alyssa like me is living with stage four metastatic breast cancer.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,800
And we talk about making lemonade out of lemons. Her journey definitely comes to mind.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,200
She is on an empowering mission to help others feel supported and comfortable during their

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,880
own cancer treatments on top of managing her own. Alyssa has founded a non-profit called

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,120
we got this, which supports cancer drivers through personalized gift-rich streets.

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,840
We'll get all into that a little bit later, but first Alyssa, welcome to the pot.

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,760
Thank you so much for being here. Thank you. So excited to meet you and chat more.

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,840
Yeah, absolutely. So I'm really happy that we're going to hear about your journey. So why don't we

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,720
start off and if you want to just give us a little intro about yourself and maybe even see it

16
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,120
up with like what was your life like before you got diagnosed and then I want to hear the whole

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,840
diagnosis story as well. Absolutely. So before getting diagnosed, I just celebrated 11 years

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,920
with my husband Eric and my whole career was mainly in sales and financial services. I was a

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,960
financial advisor and had a short stint of about four years running a cardio boxing gym and I

20
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,880
actually got really actively involved in leukemia and phoma society and team of training,

21
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,480
team and training the past about eight years doing marathons and triathons and really cool stuff

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:49,440
immersed in the cancer community, which really came back with so much love tenfold when I

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,800
ended up in this club myself and it was really interesting of course, you know, I've breast cancer

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:01,120
but a lot of my initial support really came from LLS and fellow friends in that in the early

25
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:07,760
stages where that was really all I knew of people having cancer so close to me. So transitioning

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:14,240
of it once I had the diagnosis, I feel like I've taken a lot of who I was before cancer and

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,480
channeled that into this new mission really kind of bringing in everything I've done throughout my career

28
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,080
and throughout my life in order to do something that really I feel so connected to now.

29
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:32,800
So I guess I was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer July of 2021 so it's just past three years now.

30
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:41,520
One day yeah I've been so I had my daughter in June of 2020 sorry July of 2020 and obviously

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,800
a lot going on at that time and after I had her I started having a lot of weird things happening

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,200
throughout my body nothing in my breasts but things like my feet going numb I was feeling really

33
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,920
off, achy all sorts of things as I was easing back into like normal life and I got a lot of things

34
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,200
checked out went to specialists and essentially you know the story unfortunately you hear a lot of

35
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,640
them kind of dismissing that to the fact that I had had a baby within the year. Right finally and I

36
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,240
had gone to every specialist and so I had had a breast exam everything felt normal a couple months

37
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,840
after that breast exam I had and again there was nothing near my breast it was just I was checking

38
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,920
every box of medical life of my body. My husband jokingly copped a fuel one morning when I was

39
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:36,240
getting dressed grateful that he he's still in love with me that much and felt something a bit off

40
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,200
and I hadn't felt it before we didn't feel in the breast exam and now it's when I got it checked out

41
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,840
and it was pretty wild that that lump we hadn't even felt before then ended up being metastatic

42
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:54,800
breast cancer that's crazy so were you breastfeeding during this time not during the time

43
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:01,520
I had been previously but hadn't been still and I'm very grateful at that time just coincidentally

44
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,360
then I wasn't because it very much felt like a clogged milk duct and interesting that I would have

45
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,040
most likely dismissed it I also would worry that the doctors would have to you know it's very hesitant

46
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,920
to do scans and things on breastfeeding women yeah so my initial thought was oh maybe it is like

47
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,080
an old clogged milk duct or assist and luckily I did just message the doctor I figured

48
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,880
easy enough to figure this out and when I went in I had I did not think that I had cancer like

49
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,480
even after they felt the lump in my breast they felt one of my armpit and in hindsight that's not

50
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,160
good but at the time I had no idea so they felt it in my armpit as well we did the mammogram

51
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,960
ultrasound biopsies and then it was after that that I got the call that both the biopsies were

52
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,160
malignant and then it wasn't until the pet scan that I found out it had it had also spread to my

53
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,160
liver and my lower spine and this was the first time of me visually seeing and understanding

54
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:10,320
that like I had breast cancer but more cancer my liver than I even had in my breast and that's where

55
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,200
there's just so much that I've learned in the past few years about metastatic breast cancer that

56
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,040
I never would have understood and it still is kind of counterintuitive to what we would think

57
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,320
you know that it's I don't have liver cancer I have breast cancer that had spread to my liver

58
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,320
right yeah there's so much confusion around that I know so when I got diagnosed they just told me

59
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,680
you have metastatic cancer and so they had to go back and figure out where it was originating from

60
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,960
and I didn't even know what the word metastatic met so I was like I thought it was a type of cancer

61
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,160
and so mine had spread to my spine so I was like maybe it's a cancer of the spine or like a bone

62
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,600
cancer so it took me like some education to understand like that just means that it's spread and you

63
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,080
have to figure out where it's come from but in your situation they biopsied the lump and your armpit

64
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,160
first and figured out it was breast cancer and then they saw the liver and the spine yeah so the

65
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,440
breast and the armpit so kind of knowing that it was originating from the breast and got back

66
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:19,120
then that it was her two positive ER impure negative and and with metastatic like you're saying

67
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,680
you know I started looking at Facebook groups and other things to start learning about

68
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,840
stuff that was happening and seeing people say things like I had met here met some my bone I'm like

69
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,840
what are met you I didn't understand what any of it was and I try to remember that as we talk

70
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,880
about it now because I remember I didn't know if that was three years ago most people who don't

71
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,680
have to know what it is probably don't either yeah I thought people were saying nets I was like I don't

72
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:55,840
know yeah I honestly was like also weird and confusing every playing basketball after or what did you

73
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,920
remember like how did you feel emotionally like what was going through your head at that time you

74
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,560
just like had your daughter and like seems like you know a brand new chapter of life like what did

75
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:12,640
you feel it was of course shocking but I had gone through this whole year of feeling like something

76
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:20,400
was wrong and so I felt not crazy anymore you know I felt like validated but I wish I wasn't validated

77
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,000
in that way so it was a lot of really confusing feelings when I got the phone call of the initial

78
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,040
biopsy results it was a really surreal because it was the radiologist who did the biopsies wasn't

79
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,920
in that day which it kind of knew an advance she had warned me of that that I might get the results

80
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,560
you know and I remember saying after the biopsies like do you have any hunches or that I mean I

81
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,000
really didn't think I had cancer and she was like yeah I don't like to make any assumptions

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,320
you know or say and I'm like in my head I'm like oh yeah I don't have cancer but right now looking

83
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,080
back it's like oh she totally knew that I did she knew I'm just kidding now I know because you know

84
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,760
they tell us a little bit more now that we're like more veteran cancer people yeah yeah but

85
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,640
at the time I remember I picked up the phone I was doing my makeup for work meeting I had at the

86
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,680
time and I remember just kind of looking at myself in the mirror as I'm like talking to the

87
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,560
radiologist and I remember him saying both the biopsies came back and unfortunately they were

88
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,480
malignant and I just like pause it was like so are you telling me that I have breast cancer

89
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,560
and he's like yes and they didn't he didn't have any other information at that time so it was

90
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,600
literally just getting a phone call it was a Friday so I knew that if I didn't get more information

91
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:43,440
by the end of the day I wasn't going to till Monday so I really pushed hard to find out more

92
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,920
luckily I have people in my family and circle of friends in the medical field who kind of told

93
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:56,240
me which questions to push and ask for so it was able to get on the phone with the surgeon

94
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,720
I was with Kaiser at the time and they have you meet with the surgeon before the young

95
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,400
collegeist okay doesn't make too much sense to me especially since I've never met her again

96
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:13,200
and I've never needed a surgeon since but yeah it was kind of odd but she was she was great and she

97
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,080
answered a lot of my questions and that was when I found out when she called me back a few hours later

98
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,320
I remember it was on speaker my mom was visiting at the time we had been running out to run an

99
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:30,160
air and when she called and it was when she said like we're going to do more tests and scans but

100
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,880
you know will for sure start off with about you know six to eight rounds of chemo it'll be about

101
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:44,320
you know a few months and that's when everything was like oh like I like have cancer like

102
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,520
not that it's not if not just like all the stereotypes that you picture and see like that started flooding

103
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:59,200
into my mind and realizing that this is something that is totally of course life changing no matter

104
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,320
what but then it wasn't until we saw the pet scan results and all the lights up when I'm like

105
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,960
am I dying you know like yeah these are things that you know and then after my initial chemo

106
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,360
about four months in with her septid and progetta ended up having a recurrence in my breast and in my

107
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,360
brain and again you're like am I dying like these are things that we hear in life and depending on

108
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:29,520
the type of cancer in the situation it's so different I've never understood how vague the word cancer is

109
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:35,440
until having yeah yeah absolutely and I think I mean honestly like you're giving me chills like saying

110
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:41,920
this like it's just really like I I can like totally picture myself and you know how you're describing

111
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,840
it and the scenario and it's just the word cancer is weird because like for me like what's like

112
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,280
before having cancer you just hear like people get cancer and people get better you hear that and

113
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,760
then you also hear people die from cancer right so you hear both sides of the spectrum and then

114
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,560
I think when you get diagnosed and you don't have an early stage diagnosis you have a late stage

115
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,560
diagnosis it's so scary right because like it does feel like I mean people only die from stage

116
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:15,920
for right so that is obviously a very normal natural thought is that am I going to die and I feel

117
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,920
like doctors try to shield you from the truth right because they want to be positive and they're like

118
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,720
no we've got these treatments and like we're going to do this but I mean at the end of the day they

119
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,920
don't know how you're going to respond to it and so I think that fear of like am I going to die

120
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,640
is like very normal and natural and sadly just you know it is that that's a scenario that you're in.

121
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,280
I think that's such a great point to that you said with you know that they're trying to like be

122
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,000
careful and they don't know how you're going to react so sometimes you don't know like are you

123
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,840
putting on kid gloves for me or is this okay and you know after having brain meds

124
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,480
yeah he's in the word meds but after having those and being treated so quickly for them

125
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,120
and having you know as much of a complete response as I could have right now on my brain it's unbelievable

126
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,520
to me like I didn't have brain surgery like through chemo the fact that that can be treated like

127
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,120
I hope that more people can know that because I think a lot of people get so scared about

128
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,600
getting tested because of what the results might be and having the results not be good and having

129
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,680
them feel like saying that I normally would have thought I would like die from but it was something

130
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,920
that was able to be really well treated and I very much live my life now and all that like that's

131
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,040
I'm one of them before yeah that's amazing I mean you're you're outlook on it is like

132
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,640
I followed in Instagram for a while I think probably since I got diagnosed and it's just really

133
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:54,000
inspirational I just thank you like obviously it's like such a heavy disease and diagnosis

134
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,480
to live with but you're attitude around it is really inspirational just really amazing

135
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,800
but likewise and all the conversations you have and the more that people talk you realize that

136
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,480
we're just it's like a fingerprint we're all so different and yeah even I mean I haven't met

137
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,440
anyone with like exact scenarios but even when you meet people you can relate on a lot of things

138
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:21,360
I learned so much every conversation I have with someone else yeah absolutely so a lot of so

139
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,760
your receptors are your estrogen progesterone negative and then her two positive right yes yeah okay so

140
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,960
when you and so I'm the opposite I'm estrogen progesterone positive her two negative

141
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,920
opposite to drag you know how does you feel when you heard that because I guess like

142
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,680
I don't know like people are I feel like people are like oh that's a good one and that's a bad one

143
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,000
and you know what did you have any thoughts like that like oh I have a targeted one or I have

144
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,320
not like what did you feel so initially one of the relatives that I spoke to you know because her

145
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,440
two positive did not have a lot of treatments not that long ago so it's kind of told I had a

146
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,000
really really bad one and then and then you know you start learning more in realizing that there

147
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,880
are a lot of targeted therapy so like I'm grateful in the bad scenario that there's targeted

148
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,040
therapies to have I just confused that it wasn't hormone positive I grew up with enemy triosis so

149
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,840
I've been on birth control and treated for enemy triosis since middle school and I was kind of

150
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:28,160
surprised like that it wasn't hormone related it didn't none of it makes sense and I also have

151
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:36,160
family history I just I don't have brakna no genetic mutation right I was more so just confused

152
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,720
by what all that meant and then as I learned more I think it still ends up being kind of confusing

153
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,560
because when people say things like this is good or this is bad and then you see someone who passes

154
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:55,040
away from the thing that someone said was the good one and you start feeling like of course we know

155
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:02,560
that it all sucks it's just even the scenarios where you feel like oh maybe this is better or this

156
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:09,520
is I think we always have to remind ourselves that we're all unique and different and having the right

157
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:15,120
care team and the people to understand that and treat us like that I think is ultimately the most

158
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,600
important thing to not categorize ourselves by those different categories yeah totally I think it's like

159
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,520
I think so many of us get caught up in the stats right so like you're like okay so I've got this type

160
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,640
of cancer and like the stats say this so like I'm gonna be in this bucket but like there's so many

161
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:39,120
variances within each of the categories and so you know even like my oncologist will tell me like

162
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,800
we just don't know you just have to kind of like stay positive and like we got to just make sure

163
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,680
that we're putting you in the right treatments in the right order and then you kind of just you know

164
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,160
do the most that you can that's in your control as well yeah my initial oncologist you know

165
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,200
and I pushed like I pushed to get stats so it's like because I'm again I'm like am I dying like

166
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,480
what is half of it and I was like can I just get an idea of like where this is at and what you're

167
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,000
trying to tell me and so she was kind of giving me the stats and she's like you know 20%

168
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,840
make it past five years while the average is 18 to 24 months that's very outdated and she

169
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,280
says they'll always remember she said I have patients that are six to seven years out

170
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:31,520
and I'm like I am 34 you know 37 I was 34 at the time like were you just trying to encourage me

171
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,960
by telling me that I'm gonna live to 40 yeah like it just it stuck with me so much and then

172
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:44,080
I'm not at Kaiser anymore and I am treated at UCLA I have unbelievable oncologists I had

173
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,400
Dr. Sarah Herwitz initially she went on to do more research and my oncologist now

174
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,760
Dr. Lipstick Sharf is wonderful and I remember when I moved over to Dr. Herwitz and her being like

175
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,120
no no no like you're in the golden age of her two positive breast cancer and we're going to

176
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,360
keep you alive so that we can keep having more treatments for you to stay alive and like yeah this

177
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:13,200
this the plan is for this to be a chronic disease not a terminal one and now like maybe

178
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,840
you feel like okay regardless of if we're at that point yet or not I want to be with the

179
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:24,240
care team who believes that and like is that part of figuring that out yeah totally I mean so yeah I was

180
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,800
35 when I got diagnosed and they told me 50% chance of making it to 40 or making it five years

181
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,280
and I was like and they were saying it like a good thing almost like okay so like you've got five

182
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:41,200
years probably and I was like that's only till 40 like that's so young and that's really not like

183
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,840
a gold post right like that's just not it's not enough life and so I've met with other oncologists

184
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,680
and other doctors and you know gotten told you know those are old stats like that's not the data

185
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,640
like we don't even we're not even quoting data anymore because like the treatments being used

186
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:06,720
now just haven't been around long enough to know how they're going to do and it's just really

187
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,720
it's hard because you want to like word data people right so we just I am actually I had asked

188
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,400
the hospital at that time I said I want to see the actual data like give me like the Excel spreadsheet

189
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,000
I want to see like you know obviously like blur out the names that I want to see like how old

190
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,720
these people are like what's their prior history and they were like no we don't give out that data

191
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,440
it's just not like that but I wanted to know like where do I actually fall within this data group

192
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:38,640
but not just here's an average but yeah it's really crazy so it sounds like you had a really

193
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,360
good support system around you can you talk to us a little bit about you know family friends and

194
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:50,800
how did that play into your support yeah absolutely I mean I'm very grateful and and lucky

195
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,200
to have such a great support system and I think a lot of that like your first question is

196
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,440
they thought about the old Alyssa and knew who I was going to be with cancer of it in terms

197
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,640
of my personality so when I started bringing up you know crazy ideas and things I wanted to do

198
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,240
throughout chemo you know the people really know me didn't bad and I knew that that's I was doing

199
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,840
it so they had to hop on board or I was going to do it anyway yeah and then I'm referring to you know

200
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,520
starting my non-profit and other things throughout but when I was first diagnosed you know the biggest

201
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:30,560
thing was everyone was asking how they can help and what they could do and it's such a special thing

202
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,360
to know that you have so many people want to help you and that's what I think made it feel like

203
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:41,360
something I needed to find a solution for because it shouldn't feel like this unintentional burden

204
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,800
like it shouldn't be a negative thing that so many people want to help us and it did feel that way

205
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:52,000
because I had so much to respond to and I didn't want to ask for help and I wanted them to know

206
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,440
how much I appreciated that they cared and then I thought about the year earlier when I had my daughter

207
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,960
and using baby lest or when I was getting married and having a wedding registry and I feel

208
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,760
comfortable having to go find me for myself and my good friend Amber who now works with me out

209
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:14,480
we got this she actually did a meal train for us and she put in the notes like if you really want

210
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,880
to make them a meal like let me know and I'll help coordinate she's like but it would really be

211
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,080
most helpful if you just sent gift cards because you know I couldn't taste for weeks at a time

212
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,000
I didn't know what diet I was going to follow all that kind of stuff right so everyone sent

213
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,960
gift cards which was it really was unbelievably helpful because our kitchen was gutted at the time

214
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,600
when I was diagnosed we were doing construction on our house so I never kitchen and it was

215
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,280
really from now I was like there really should be a gift registry for cancer patients a lot

216
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,480
happened in between that of course but it was yeah my like fifth round of chemo when I was just like

217
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,760
this sucks and what am I doing with it and I need to do something and that's when the idea kind

218
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,360
of came about to bring in the community of supporters that want to help and of course you know my

219
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:08,160
primary caregiver being my husband who that initial time and I talked talked about this before that

220
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:14,800
we were in the office when we saw the pet scan and you see visually on the screen just they explained

221
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:22,320
to you that like anything lit up could be cancer and it was just like a sea of lights and that was

222
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:30,400
when my husband just went white and he was like had to breathe into a paper bag it was like

223
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,960
really having a panic attack and we had no idea how to channel all of this and ever since then

224
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:44,160
he's just like he got it all out of his system and now he's just really rolled with the punches

225
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:50,480
and been a part of every step with me the way that I wanted to handle it. The biggest turning point

226
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,360
I think being when I did have the brain mats and I was on and hurt too and to catnip as a part

227
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,840
of a clinical trial and I just really lost my quality of life and it worked so well but making

228
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,920
that decision to make a change was saying that my husband and my parents you know people closest

229
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:13,600
to us supported and I know that that was really hard for them to support me moving off of a treatment

230
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,840
that was working and because of that I've gone into really live the past two years you know whereas

231
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,600
even though it was working it wasn't working for me in my quality of life and how the people around

232
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,560
you care about all of you not just them getting to be with you is something that I've learned because

233
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,680
I think on the flip side I would have felt like you need to just keep going you know like just keep

234
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:43,040
doing this because they need you here but being willing to take that chance with me and support

235
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,720
me through that was a huge part of my support team. Yeah that's amazing I totally think that

236
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,280
our family really just you know they they want us to be around right and so that's their biggest goal

237
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:59,280
but you know I think it's like to to what extent right if you're just miserable and you're not

238
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,400
really functioning then how is that you know you really being around so that's that's amazing that

239
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,880
your family is supportive and your husband was supportive about you getting off of that treatment

240
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,760
how did it go telling your oncologist that like did they take it like we're I mean did they

241
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,600
did they try to encourage you to stay back on it? No and actually in my head I was like why didn't

242
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,520
I mention the sooner because when I did finally I just got to that point you know it was like each

243
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,200
round my husband I would talk and I'd be like I don't know how much longer I can do this like

244
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,920
I couldn't wake up without throwing up that I was taking medicine to stay asleep all day like

245
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,160
I literally wasn't living other than maybe like up to five to seven days every three weeks

246
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:48,240
in betraying fusions so I'd brought it up a little bit earlier we couldn't lower the dose

247
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,800
because of the fact that I was a part of a clinical trial so even though both drugs were FDA

248
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,760
approved combining them for breast cancer was the trial and I really wanted to stay on that because

249
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:05,520
again that brain tumors and it was working yeah so when I finally did like say to my oncologist like

250
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:12,480
I don't know that I want to live like like this like I wake up and I think to myself like living

251
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,160
is too hard like I don't know that I can keep doing this and she's like well then like this isn't

252
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:23,600
working and I was like what do you mean she's like what's like working like on the cancer but like

253
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,640
that's only half of it like you're a human like you need to live too she's like if you feel that

254
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:36,800
drastic about this like we need to change it and I didn't realize how many options I knew

255
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,920
that more options existed right but I always kind of thought of it like a cat with eight lives

256
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:48,800
and you're like knocking off a life yeah it's like you'll just say my right and and that was when

257
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:54,560
she was like you know you can stay apart of the study if you want but why don't we switch drugs

258
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,600
and that's when I switch to what I've been on now which is Zalota to Katnib and her saptin

259
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,680
and that was kind of comforting that two of the drugs or things I already had and yeah I'm so

260
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,560
grateful that that was her reaction and then she kind of left it to me of being like this is something

261
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:16,400
you can do now so you just tell me like do you want to try doing this longer because it's working

262
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:23,040
do you want to just stop and it was towards the end of the year and I was like I'm going to start

263
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:29,680
the new year trying to take my life back and like I am forever grateful that I did I

264
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:35,520
had the past couple years what I've gotten to do and live as amazing I do have a little bit

265
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,240
of a potential recurrence right now my left breast but you know we're working through it and

266
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,240
figuring it out and knowing that there's options like that like I knew that right like we kind of

267
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,000
get told that but you don't really feel that until your medical team and your support system

268
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,920
are like on that train with you and so now that we've done that I'm like okay I do believe now

269
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,400
that I have options yeah now that's great I think I always kind of have this

270
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,400
I mean I'm just an anxious person in general but I think I definitely with this like my anxiety

271
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,960
peaks in the sense like I want to know how many options like I'm eye on option like

272
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,280
three of five or is it three of 30 like what's the number and like you don't really get a clear answer

273
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,920
but like there are so many options there's so many different combinations of drugs that you

274
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:31,200
can take and so I think you know where we are like where medicine is with metastatic breast cancer

275
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,840
right now like there are there are a lot of options and so I think the goal is really to stay

276
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,120
hopeful and also I think to your point it's like if something's not working for you like you should

277
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,640
talk to your cancer care team and let them know that you're miserable because I don't think

278
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,280
like that really isn't the goal like what you're in college just said like it's just because

279
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:58,000
it's working on the cancer doesn't mean it's working overall for you and if she had said to me like

280
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,040
Alyssa you might die if we stop like if she was really concerned I would have reevaluated maybe

281
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,680
the way I looked at it you know maybe if I knew that that was my only option maybe I would have

282
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,240
been grateful for that five to seven days every three weeks that I lived you know and you

283
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,320
reset maybe what you think that bar is but knowing that she didn't like didn't even hesitate

284
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,000
that this isn't how I had to live you know think that I spoke up and I think that's the the

285
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,800
biggest thing you know she just didn't fully get how much I was struggling and you know and that's

286
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:39,680
also because I I try not to like I want to be happy and live but yes speaking up is important just

287
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,720
like speaking up if you feel something that's all yeah do you ever feel like I've gotten better

288
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,760
about this but I think initially I was not scared of my oncologist but a little bit like okay like

289
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,720
I want to be a really good patient and like you know listen to everything they're saying but I think

290
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,680
I've kind of learned that you know we're on a team together me and the oncologist it's not

291
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,080
them you know telling me what to do it's them telling me options of what I can do and then it's my you

292
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,280
know it's my decision at the end of the day what I want to do with it yeah my oncologist Dr

293
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:16,640
Herbert at the time was director of clinical trials from UCLA and so every time I'd be offered

294
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,520
something I would always have the option of a clinical trial like after I got off of in her to

295
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:28,080
into catnip I was offered to be on a clinical trial for something else and reviewing it it didn't

296
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,320
feel like as good of a fit for me so I chose not to do it but yeah having those options really

297
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:39,760
I felt like in general having a medical team where they recommend something or they give you

298
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,680
those options and while I always still have more conversations and do more research in general

299
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:53,920
I like really trust my team so initially I didn't and when they would say things or other things

300
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:00,800
I'd kind of feel like I'd need to do so much more research because not like it didn't trust them but

301
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:07,760
I didn't feel like I had all the resources at my disposal and now that I do it makes it a lot easier

302
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:14,560
to feel like okay I want to be the good patient I want them to love me but also want to like

303
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,600
make the choice that feels best and having the choices laid out for you already give you the confidence

304
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,360
that like who's giving them really cares and understands the full spectrum what's available

305
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,200
has like changed that perception for me yeah I think that's really important when you were at Kaiser

306
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,240
did you ask like you know are you guys part of any clinical trials do you have any connections to them

307
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,760
or was that not something that was on your radar at that point so the initial chemo felt really

308
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:50,080
straightforward to me so it didn't feel like that was necessary but even given that so like I started

309
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:56,960
out with TCHP so it was taxiture carbo plan her sets an impurgent and then when I got I didn't

310
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,800
get a second opinion at first I also I mean I did like I made phone calls and things but what

311
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,680
happened being in the heat of COVID and so much else going on I actually started chemo before

312
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:14,720
I met my oncologist it was very out of the ordinary but if I wanted to wait to meet the oncologist

313
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,600
I was going to have to wait in additional month for chemo and I just wasn't willing to do that so I

314
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,120
started the first year rounds with TCHP and then once the dust kind of settled I actually got a

315
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,320
second opinion within Kaiser and I ended up switching oncologists within Kaiser and I really liked

316
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,360
my second oncologist if I didn't have the opportunity at UCLA to switch I would have been happy

317
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:41,680
with her okay she immediately switched my chemo to THP she's like you don't need carbo plan

318
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:46,320
and you know your cancer is not curative like we don't need to blast you harder than necessary

319
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,800
and it's not like adding in the carbo plan and it was like gonna kill me but I was

320
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,440
getting I was throwing up more I was having a lot more severe symptoms and like even that little

321
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,400
tweak made me realize early on like this matters like who's helping you matters that my

322
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,360
original oncologist wasn't up to speed on like the current golden standard of care

323
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,320
right but she's prescribed me was fine it wasn't like malpractice or anything it's just it wasn't

324
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:18,160
necessary I also think that the initial oncologist took my direction as a patient

325
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:26,480
like too much like didn't educate me so I go in right like I'm a former athlete you know and

326
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,840
all it like hit me with whatever we got like take my breath do whatever you have to do like let's go

327
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,200
as aggressive as possible and then you learn like oh removing my breasts isn't going to benefit

328
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,960
me for metastatic breast cancer and yeah all that but I think that she took so literally my

329
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,040
like willingness that she made it as aggressive as it could be and I think she said that after

330
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,560
and I did switch is like why do we add that I've not actually you said you wanted to be aggressive

331
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:59,600
and I felt like I wasn't given the full information the lay of the land yeah I think that's like

332
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,880
one I mean I get I'm sure you do too I get asked so many questions like on constant or on repeat

333
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,960
one of them is definitely like you know why don't they take the original lump out like why don't

334
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,240
you have surgery like since mine is hormone driven I'm on hormone targeted treatment and said I

335
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,000
just like IV chemo overall right now and so I get a lot of those questions and it's a lot of educating

336
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,120
people and you know that's on how it's done but it also you know it's those are valid questions

337
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,680
and it's still hard to grasp that with metastatic you know you taking out the original source

338
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:37,680
is not going to overall like systemically help your cancer if it's already spread you have to

339
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:43,520
treat the body as a whole um did you grasp like have trouble grasping that concept yourself

340
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,600
initially that you weren't going to have a surgery to remove the tumor yeah such a good

341
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,800
question yeah I can so relate to everything that you're saying and initially when it was explained

342
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:58,000
to me I was like okay understand like we can't remove part of my spine we can't remove my whole

343
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,080
liver yeah that piece made sense and then recently like just a few months ago when we found

344
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,400
more tumors in my left breast that ended up being the same cancer that's when I was like okay

345
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:15,200
so do we remove my breast now like it's contained should we remove it and even my oncologist was like

346
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,320
let's let's have you meet with the surgeon and let's talk it out and so I did and she was like

347
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,400
she was like again from your scans like there's a lot of little tumors in there like so if we

348
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,120
did a lump back to me what are we taking out are we taking out all of those like we can't

349
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,840
do you want to do biopsies and all those like you know and then as a whole can we just remove them

350
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,120
and she's like if we remove them the amount of time that you're going to have to pause your

351
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:47,120
chemo right now is so much more dangerous than cancer in your breast right it was such a good reminder

352
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,800
of um and I did uh I messaged Dr. De Plinsky about this if you follow her as well

353
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:59,040
love her and I was like can you help me articulate this because I'm answering it so much

354
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,480
to do like as well as I did a post together about it and yeah even watching her explain it which again

355
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,000
I was the one who reached out to ask her to explain like I still needed that reminder and like I still

356
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,440
do I sometimes look back to it because I'm like yes that's why like we can't remove my brain

357
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,800
you know right at the end of the day if I'm not going to die from cancer my brows then

358
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,360
why risk the rest of my body getting infiltrated yeah now I think that's an important point so it's like

359
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:32,720
if you're listening and the clarification I think is like so when you have a surgery you have to

360
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,280
stop your chemo or your hormone treatments whatever other treatments you're on because your

361
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,080
your immune system needs that time to recover from the surgery and you can't double up on doing

362
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:47,920
chemo and a surgery at the same time so you would be off of your systemic treatment while you're

363
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:53,680
recovering from surgery and a lot of times the thought process there is like that time off of your

364
00:34:53,680 --> 00:35:01,920
treatment is more problematic and more you know bad for your body than taking out that tumor and so

365
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,240
it's you know it's just something I have to remind myself of of as well yeah me too like even

366
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,640
saying it I'm like yeah don't do that I remember seeing you posted about having back pain I

367
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:21,440
know a message to you about that and that's been on an often issue for me throughout treatment and

368
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,920
it's something most recently that I mean we did like I was in MRIs for like three hours to do

369
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,400
all the parts my back we just wanted to make sure like hundred percent there's no cancer there and

370
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,040
there's not yeah um that's all it's it which is great greatness but it's still like a debilitating

371
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,800
symptom which I think might have to do with my enemy triosis growing back now that I'm not treating

372
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,120
that and so I am voluntarily scheduling a hysterectomy leaving my ovaries since I don't need to go

373
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,680
through early metapause since I'm not hormone positive okay and that's something that I wanted to

374
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,040
do a couple years ago that with the brain tumors they're like let's not do electrosurgies but that's

375
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,880
really like weighing things out so like the hysterectomy would be just a couple weeks off of you know

376
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,960
probably just missing the two catnip wouldn't even maybe even have to miss my chemo pill I wouldn't

377
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,400
have to miss receptin but that's where like having those conversations that was something we said

378
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,120
wouldn't make sense a couple years ago I brought up again and we kind of talked it through and it

379
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:26,720
could make sense now so like also not being afraid to ask those questions like even me asking again

380
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:33,200
like should I just do a dull mastectomy now what did it take off our time right in extra appointment

381
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:39,440
for me to totally understand it and feel comfortable again yeah absolutely so do you have

382
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,520
you made a decision yet on do you want to go forward with the hysterectomy or you still considering

383
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:50,000
that I I have decided to go forward with it it's just a timing thing trying to do it sooner than

384
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,640
later because we're also waiting to do another breast MRI to I'm on like pause with we don't want

385
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,520
to change my treatment because everything else is working like my brain might start growing back

386
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,520
there's nothing in my liver anywhere else so there honestly it's a little confused like why

387
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,160
more grew my breast and I think that they were kind of expecting it to look different maybe

388
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,520
it would be fine positive or different breast cancer right and since it's also her too positive

389
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:25,760
it's confusing and my options were like that we could do a breast MRI guided biopsies

390
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,840
or wait and the surgeon was like honestly I really don't want to put you through the

391
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:38,240
breast MRI biopsies for us to probably just find out the same info again so in a month I'm

392
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,600
getting another breast MRI so I think once we do that we'll just evaluate the timing and

393
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,720
make sure I don't need to be like urgently switch to something but for now I'm continuing on my

394
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:54,000
current chemo and it's working everywhere else so they feel comfortable that like other than this

395
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,480
one weird question mark that like I am mostly stable and it's working good that's awesome

396
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:08,400
one thing I just popped in so for my back so I have metastasis all like all over my spine

397
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,280
all over my pelvic bones my ribcage sternum it's like literally my entire yeah so when you talk

398
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,080
about scans lighting up like when I get mine and the screens there it's just like all lit up

399
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:25,040
but one thing I do get on a monthly basis is this injection called XGPA have you heard of that?

400
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:32,160
no I'm not familiar with that okay so it's like this bone strengthening agent and it helps

401
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,360
like if there is like weakness like fracture or like fractures possibly coming or metastasis in

402
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:42,560
your bone so I wonder for you if that's an option yeah so look into that what's the other

403
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:51,200
um infusion brain I'm you sorry bone medicine um oh my god I'm blanking I get it like that

404
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,800
few months is it Zometa or Zometa yeah Zometa yeah it's got similar a different injection

405
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,920
it's similar I think it's the same like base ingredient so yeah if you're getting that it has that

406
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,040
do you have have you noticed any difference in your bones from that or no I've been getting it the whole

407
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,480
so yeah so the the pain I'm getting I don't know it feels more muscular like it but I know

408
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,960
the difference like and I was doing physical therapy for so long and all that it wasn't fixing it

409
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,960
but yeah I'll definitely ask about that too thank you yeah so you um so you're I also used to work

410
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,800
out of time before I got diagnosed it's something that I missed doing because I used to go to like

411
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,000
high intensity classes and do like boxing and do all of that so I've had to you know change how I

412
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,680
do my workouts now but I like really do believe like to help with that bone pain if you can like

413
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,200
strengthen the muscles around it that can really help alleviate like the weight that goes on your

414
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,320
bones have you found like any like particular types of workouts that you have found beneficial

415
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,320
yeah I mean definitely boxing um because it also helps of course like strengthening my core and

416
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:04,320
all that from my back um and I just I've always like boxing and a boxing gym and also I just feel

417
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,800
like it's such a low risk unless you're actually fighting but it's a low risk workout you know

418
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,160
like you're getting cardio with strength training you know from the resistance um I also have gone

419
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:19,360
really into golf since being diagnosed I used to play tennis a lot and I still play tennis but it was

420
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:24,400
very high impact like well really well starting chemo and getting used to all that it's still kind of

421
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:31,520
is but um with golf like really moving my body and being outdoors for a long time and all that

422
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:36,720
I've found to be really helpful as well oh okay awesome my husband's a big golfer so maybe I'll

423
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:43,680
join him yeah let me know I'll come up north and uh we can all be happy awesome so one thing that

424
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,680
I've like seen on your social media is like you you use them or you use the word driver instead of

425
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,880
like living with or like just surviving I want to hear a little bit about like your mindset

426
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:03,520
what makes you want to use that word and like embrace the cancer versus and treat it like

427
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:09,040
more like a chronic illness than just being like a terminal diagnosis. I first heard the term

428
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:15,760
driver being like through metaviver and metastatic patients you know talking about it and I thought

429
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,360
about the word survivor and driver together and before having cancer someone would like ask how

430
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,520
your day's going or something like that you'd be like oh it's all right like I'm surviving

431
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:33,200
I never felt like survival was my goal as a human without cancer and so I felt like making that

432
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:39,280
the accomplishment with cancer was minimizing us as humans like I don't think there's anything wrong

433
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,600
with them not offended by the word survivor anything like that it's just not my goal like it wasn't

434
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:49,360
my goal before cancer it's not my goal now like I hope that I'm alive like that's bare minimum

435
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:53,840
but to actually live life that's where I feel like that's where I identify more worth

436
00:41:53,840 --> 00:42:01,280
arriving because I feel then I really felt that when I was on and her too and I felt like I didn't know

437
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:07,200
how I could continue to live I knew that I wasn't dying because it was working so well in my

438
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:14,080
cancer but I also was really in touch with the fact that I wasn't living and being in touch with

439
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:20,240
thought and embracing the fact that that is just as important was so important for me to get to live

440
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,760
again so that's why I really just think that living with cancer, thriving, not just staying

441
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:33,120
alive and surviving is really the goal there definitely days where I'm just surviving right like we

442
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:37,200
all are so like I always try to stress like you don't have to start a non-profit during chemo like

443
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,800
you don't have you know like it would have been fine if I just wanted to learn how to golf and golf

444
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,320
every day you know like yeah do what makes sense and feels good for you but I hope that people you

445
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:54,480
value themselves enough to not take you know other people's pressure or perception of cancer

446
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,080
and minimize whatever it is that they want to live in their life. Yeah totally I think it's like

447
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:05,840
it's such a personal journey I know like the first year I had met a static I was just I would say

448
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:10,320
I was just like trying to survive I was just trying to get through and I didn't really want

449
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,800
cancer to define me like I didn't really see myself as being someone that was going to be like

450
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,840
I've got cancer and like I'm doing you know X, Y and Z I just didn't think that was like a part of

451
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:25,440
my personality and then something hit around like the one year mark where I was just I don't know

452
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,600
if it was like this real fear set in I've like I don't know if I'm gonna make it I already switched

453
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,840
treatments a couple of times and I think I just had this like wake up moment where I was like

454
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:41,520
I have to do something I have to do something beyond just like the minimum to get by it's it's

455
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,840
it was more than just like doing my treatments like I needed to just take a little bit of control

456
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:54,080
and be more proactive in my healing journey and that's where I started doing a lot more like

457
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:57,680
I started meditating a lot I started looking a lot more until like my diet nutrition

458
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,080
exercises and you know doing more advocacy stuff and connecting with people in the community and I

459
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:10,400
think that shift of the last like this past year and now it's like I feel like I'm thriving now

460
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,720
because I'm just more you know a part of it I'm embracing it and I'm not just trying to get by any more

461
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,960
yeah I love that are there any terms that like you don't like in particular or like more than

462
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:29,280
others in in that realm of the thriving surviving stuff so I think yeah thriving so like those are

463
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,680
fine I think one thing that really always works mean I don't know if you feel this way is that when

464
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:40,480
people are like be strong like I just don't really to me it's like a really silly thing to say

465
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,480
it's like we don't really have a choice like I have to just get through this and so I think

466
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,320
people like stay strong be strong or um I also don't really love when people like keep fighting

467
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,360
I think that one for some reason or excuse me as well what about for you or doing it those

468
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:02,000
resonate yeah I mean for the most part I've kind of taken this lens of like I feel like not everything

469
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:06,400
has to be a teaching moment so like I've had people say some pretty messed up things you know

470
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,160
like especially when you're bald and you don't have a choice of whether or not people know you have

471
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,800
cancer yeah and in a lot of people when like friends they'll tell it to they'll be like why

472
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,880
didn't you say sign I'm like because I didn't want to like I didn't want to have that conversation

473
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,720
so like I was gonna do to myself but um the biggest thing is like I've made this whole thing

474
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:30,480
around the mission of we got this so I do think it's funny and if anyone do this it's like not a big

475
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:35,600
deal nothing offense me but it's funny when people will still comment sometimes on some of my posts

476
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:45,680
or say to me in person like you're so strong you got this and that like to me is just funny because

477
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,320
yeah especially when it's like very well-intentioned people and people who are morally really

478
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:55,760
support what I'm doing in my mission but like that's the biggest thing with we got this is like you

479
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,120
know it's not meant to be corny it like I truly feel it wholeheartedly that yeah I would always say

480
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:06,240
I got this like when I was diagnosed and I was telling like when I had to tell my husband at first

481
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:12,080
I got the call like by myself and I'm like it's okay like I got this like I'll do whatever I have to do

482
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,080
and it felt so weird saying that and then people saying you got this it's like kind of removing

483
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:24,560
themselves like you got it you know yeah so it's okay not everyone like has to be actively on my team

484
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:30,320
but I really I think it's a we thing to me it just feels much better so I just think it's funny

485
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:36,160
because like that's been my thing so when people best it's like um when people reply to an email

486
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:41,360
and they spell your name wrong which I'm sure you like it does to me it's like no it's right there

487
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:48,640
like my email literally you literally right I don't think like it depends like what what

488
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,520
day or like what time of the day you catch me like it maybe just be like a well-intentioned comment

489
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,200
but like if I'm not feeling good and someone's like says something like that to me that I'm just like

490
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,360
like that's not what I want to hear right now but like another day where I'm like feeling fine and like

491
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:06,560
out and about I'll be like oh yes like I can do this too so it just really it depends and I think

492
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:13,120
it's always important to remember like people are well-intentioned and so um you know just don't always

493
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:18,960
know the right thing to say at the right time yeah I think that were really conditioned to feel like

494
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:25,360
we need cures for things and that's saying that I really feel a lot is like I don't mind you know

495
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:31,040
opinions on nutrition and fitness like that's been a huge part of my life like forever but what

496
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:36,960
what does bother me is seeing things like posts or like when celebrities come out with certain

497
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:43,120
alternative things some can be good some not and it's very misleading on that like not everything

498
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:48,560
has to cure cancer like we don't just need to eat healthy because it'll prevent your cancer

499
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,080
like there's also things we can do because we want to like live comfortably and like you know like

500
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:59,680
if like you don't have to do cardio to have fat loss but you might want to do cardio to like have

501
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:07,760
a healthy heart so that like finding the end not the or like I you know I do chemo I take

502
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,560
meds if I need them but I also go to acupuncture regularly from my back too you know it doesn't

503
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:18,800
have to be one or the other like we can do multiple things and both can be true yeah absolutely I

504
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,320
mean I'm like big into like juicing right like I have a blender full of like juice like throughout

505
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:29,200
the day and people then you read some posts and people like oh like that's all like garbage like

506
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,560
it's not gonna cure cancer and I'm like I I don't think it's curing my cancer but I know it's making

507
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:39,840
me feel better and like if my immune system is stronger I think that overall is gonna help me

508
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:45,600
fight whatever disease it is that I have and so I think it's like you don't have to look for the

509
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,400
cure quote unquote but just find things that make you feel good and if you're physically feeling

510
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,880
better and mentally feeling better that's overall gonna help you with whatever's going on your body

511
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,520
yeah I couldn't agree more my I love juicing too um yeah I'm not gonna like quit chemo and only

512
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,960
juice just like personally that's not what I think will keep me alive but I definitely love having

513
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:12,400
juice and make me feel good absolutely okay so I want to get into your nonprofit um tell us like

514
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,280
you spoke a little bit about like when you were going through chemo and you were thinking through like

515
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,280
what would be helpful for you what was kind of like that pivotal point that you were like I'm

516
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,640
gonna actually start an organization and get this out there. I started looking into everything

517
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,960
that already existed so it's like if something like this exists I don't want to recreate the

518
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,960
wheel I don't want to cause any competition or anything I'll just help with that and when I realized

519
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:40,880
that nothing like it did exist that's when I felt like really mission driven like okay this should

520
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,720
and how often do we really find something that we see such a need for that there's nothing like it

521
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:51,600
there was something similar at the time that doesn't exist anymore but it was like a registry

522
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:59,040
for cancer patients for profit run by doctors selling stuff in their own inventory for like medical

523
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:05,840
supplies and it was really seeing that that I was like this really needs to exist because that

524
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,400
platform the way that they did it which again doesn't even exist anymore because it didn't work

525
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:16,000
it felt so predatory to me like you know trying to sell things in the perception of

526
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,880
all this stuff and so I looked at a lot of research into it and there are lots of great for

527
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,640
profit companies that are so mission driven and that was saying I explored was in my mind I was like

528
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,960
I just want this to start as soon as it can I just wanted to exist so what's the path

529
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:40,160
the least resistance that I can do and so I looked into like venture funding and other things

530
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:45,120
if it were a for profit I looked into how I would fundraise if you were nonprofit and ultimately

531
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:49,840
I was like well I can have the most control and I can just go figure this out if I make the nonprofit

532
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:56,320
and that felt good to me and that everyone could feel like there was no company or people trying

533
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:02,400
to profit off of their symptoms and their side effects like really making it whole you know it's

534
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:08,880
my life's mission it's what I feel I wish I had so I started to go fund me for it so that's when

535
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,800
I did use go fund me and yeah enough friend of mine out here you know luckily I'm in LA and I have

536
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:20,160
a lot of really talented film friends and all that and my friend Alicia came over and we just I

537
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:25,440
just started talking I didn't script any of it I just heard like spitballing this idea and we made

538
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:31,760
the go fund me video out of it and I was gonna make the goal like 10 to 20 thousand which I thought was

539
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:36,960
a lot of money and start talking to friends like in tech and in web design all stuff and they're like

540
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:43,200
a list of like you can't do a gift registry for that amount of money and they're like you need

541
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,920
at least like 50 to 100 thousand to like get started on something this robust because it was

542
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,320
really important to me that you could register for anything so like we weren't just gonna have like

543
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:58,160
one API set up or one vendor we weren't doing it in house like you can register for literally

544
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:05,200
anything on the internet okay yeah so yeah so I so I was gonna do 10 thousand and my friend Brian

545
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:10,640
jokes now because he was like yeah I think you should do that and add a zero to it and so it was like

546
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:16,560
okay but I was like fair warning I'm not in a position right now to be able to fail like it will

547
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:22,960
kill me if I fail right so I'm like I'm going for it but like if we come short of that like give me

548
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,480
raise 30 40 thousand I would have felt like oh I got so much money but I would have been like we

549
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:32,560
missed the goal by so much yeah me let's just say we launched it we ended up raising 105 thousand off

550
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:39,440
the go find me and it was what was so unbelievable about it was of course that like instantly we

551
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:45,600
got started you know we've created this I feel in record time whereas if I had gone the investment

552
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:52,160
route maybe in five years something would have existed if it ever existed at all yeah and the proof

553
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:57,040
of of concepts like of course there's a certain amount of people who would just donate because

554
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:02,000
they care about me and believe in what I'm trying to do but there were a lot of people who

555
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,240
started donating that I didn't know who like sought from other people and I started realizing like

556
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:12,560
okay it's not just me like it's and it's not just cancer patients or survivors or thrivers

557
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:18,080
it's people who support them that want this too and that's when it all kind of changed me of like

558
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:23,360
that's why this is so important and so we've been fully funded up until now through peer to

559
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:29,840
peer fundraising fundraisers and all that I have more of a team now and it's not sustainable for

560
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:34,640
me to run so many events per year so we're starting to apply for more grants and trying to get

561
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:40,480
more larger donors and things but the way it's come together has been so bootstrapped like

562
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:47,680
community driven that it feels so good because I know that every like it is the we like everyone

563
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:53,600
is a part of it absolutely I was like I mean I worked in like many corporate jobs and I've always

564
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:58,080
just found like there's you know there's there's always like a mission statement at companies right

565
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:02,800
and so you read those mission statements but I never actually like felt aligned with them and I think

566
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,840
what you're doing for example like it sounds like everyone that's working there is like so into your

567
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:12,720
mission and that's exactly what you want right you want everyone there to be like this is what my

568
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:18,320
life's calling is and this is why I want to be here and I think to your point it's like it's not just

569
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:24,000
about if you yourself have cancer like so many other people are touched by it like whether it's family

570
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,280
or friends and I think all of us like if you don't have cancer yourself like you know someone who

571
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,320
has cancer and so there's such a like wide group of people that are like mostly everyone is affected

572
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:40,160
by this in some way definitely and yeah it makes me so grateful that I took the leap to get it

573
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:47,200
started still a leap I mean I don't pay myself and I've really prioritized just growing it and you

574
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:53,760
know like like you said I mean my team now Amber Sarah and Jillian who work with me they care as much

575
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:00,000
as I do and that's so rare to find and then the amount of endless volunteers and people involved

576
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,160
we did not dead yet fast if you saw that with Chelsea from all your so tough and you know so many

577
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,000
other nonprofits that we partner with that's like what I was saying earlier my career was

578
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:17,120
always about partnerships you know mainly sold 401k which you know it's important but this is

579
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:23,600
way more fun but when I did 401k all of my clients came through other financial advisors referral

580
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:29,920
CPAs things like that and it's essentially what you know I'm still doing now is partnering

581
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,560
with other nonprofits like for not dead yet fast leukemia lymphoma society where partners

582
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:39,840
teen cancer America you know all these other great non-profits that we can like team up

583
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:44,240
and do great things because we all do different things and we all of the same mission of helping

584
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:51,360
the cancer community yeah so all that has made it just like I can't believe I get to work on it each

585
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:56,960
day yeah you know I feel so grateful that it's what I get to do that's awesome tell me a little bit

586
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,320
about like the user site so someone listening in wants to set up a gift registry like what is

587
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:06,880
that process look like for them if you go to we got this data work right on the home page you

588
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,120
can either find a registry or start one if you scroll the bottom there's like videos walking

589
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,760
through it but it's very intuitive if you want to start one you just hit start a registry you sign

590
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:21,440
up and there's a couple ways that you can pull things in from websites you could literally just

591
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,480
copy and paste in the URL to the product that you want there's also a grabber tool it'll

592
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:32,560
explain how to use but essentially that set up so that like I said any online retailer you can

593
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:38,240
register for a big thing that I've heard that I try to really reinforce and I feel like is something

594
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:44,240
we need to normalize is a lot of people feel really comfortable registering for things like

595
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:50,320
wigs or wheelchairs or barf bags right like things that fall into the stereotypes the cancer

596
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:55,920
but like people want to help us and I think it's really important that people also register for

597
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:02,400
like date nights and hunter tickets and you know if you need funds for babysitters you can

598
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:07,760
utilize it just like a go find me too so you can link your checking account to get donations directly

599
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,800
to you so it's kind of like everything in one spot that money doesn't come to us at all it goes

600
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:18,480
directly to their account so register for anything you need I highly encourage people to do

601
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,320
all the things that will like make them more comfortable bring them or joy like that's what

602
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:27,200
keeps us living and then if you're on the supporter side or if you're starring your own

603
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:32,480
registry and you want to see what others look like if you click find a registry you can look

604
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,800
into different areas like we could look near us in California you know things like that you can

605
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:44,240
also search names or if you select let us find a driver for you it will randomly populate 20 registries

606
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:49,040
every time that's clicked so it's not an alphabetical order anything like that because we don't

607
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,760
want a favor any registry over another but as long as your registry's public you'll pop up and

608
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,880
you can see other scenarios like I've had my friend Jill from colleges with her recently and she was

609
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:04,000
like yeah I looked on and like this girl live not too far away from me had like a handful of

610
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,800
things in her registry so I just like bought it all for her and she's like she's like I felt like

611
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:14,640
so good you know and she got to like make you know the few things that that she needed so

612
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:20,320
yeah I think that's crazy I love that you're that you're also encouraging it's it doesn't

613
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:25,360
have to be something specifically for cancer it can just be something in your life that you know

614
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:30,960
that would make you happy or that would be additive to your day to day so I think that's really

615
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,720
that's really great so I want to know a little bit about like where do you like what's the future like

616
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,560
where do you see this like expanding into like how big do you want this to be?

617
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:47,680
Yeah I'm not one to do you think small but yeah I see a big I see you know big picture

618
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:53,280
it being a registry for the hard times you know not just cancer I try to remind myself that Amazon

619
00:58:53,280 --> 00:59:00,240
started selling books so you know let's like perfect something and and move forward with it I just

620
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:06,240
almost done with my book we finished the first draft of the manuscript for it some really excited

621
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:12,800
about that I have personal thank you so I'm actually launching pre-sales for that and October

622
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:19,920
I bet you can guess why it's a good month for people to listen so I figured that was a good

623
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:28,240
timing I'm really really passionate on a personal level of really my own personal mission of redefining

624
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:35,680
success so I really feel like redefining what it means to beat cancer is what I'm really

625
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:41,680
living to do and if we don't have a cure for metastatic breast cancer in our lifetime getting to do

626
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:47,120
what we do and live life and make the impact that we make like we're beating cancer every day and

627
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:52,240
I hope that people know that you know and not people having it's not just cancer right cancer

628
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:58,720
plug that in with any other thing that we go through in life so the book and speaking and really

629
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:06,320
spreading that message is a huge goal of mine over you know this time I'm really doing that too

630
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:12,080
so that I don't need to pay myself through the non-profit you know rather have the corporations

631
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:20,240
fund me so I can give everything back yeah and then with the non-profit and with we got this we

632
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:27,520
from not dead yet fast since then we've doubled in registries and we have a thousand registries now

633
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:33,040
I hope that that exponentially grows my next goal is 10,000 you know not going like one two five

634
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:40,160
or join 10 and I hope that I hope that people don't have to use it but I know that a lot of people

635
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:46,960
unfortunately do and I really hope that this becomes the norm like you get diagnosed and while

636
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:53,040
your husband's there breathing into a paper bag you get this resource you know that at least

637
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,520
can like make your lives a little bit easier and more comfortable and not make you feel alone

638
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,760
and the mission statement like you mentioned you know our mission is building a community of

639
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:07,200
giving and receiving that helps cancer drivers and their supporters live their best lives and it's

640
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:12,000
not just about the gift giving it's what that does absolutely I think that's amazing and I think

641
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,440
you know if you're listening in and like you're looking for a way to support someone like

642
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:23,520
go find me obviously it's great but like this is a really unique and specific opportunity to be able

643
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:27,680
to help in this way and I think that's really something that you know people should look into

644
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:33,440
and something that's a little unique about us versus like if you have a go find me I mean if you do

645
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:39,680
you can utilize the same features on our site so you can take donations but you can also register

646
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:44,400
for any products and services you need but also reach out to us and we'd be happy to promote your

647
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,400
so we do registries of the week we promote them through our newsletters a lot of times non-profits

648
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:56,960
and other companies can't do that it's just there's so many go find me is but it's our thing so we

649
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:02,160
can do it so you know feel free to email us anytime you know info at we got this dot org or

651
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:14,240
because I was doing a little giveaway for the magic castle and it was for a child's

652
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:19,760
a cancer awareness month which we're in and we had a child thrive or win and she messaged me and

653
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:25,760
she's like I know she's like I'm the one with cancer I have melanoma and I was diagnosed the day

654
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:30,080
that I found out I was pregnant and she's like my son's been with me a hundred percent of the way

655
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:34,720
he would love to go the castle and so I mean I get chills talking about like how was I

656
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:42,080
saying that we had a blast we went her and her husband and her son it was amazing and unfortunately

657
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:48,320
she's dealing with some new brain mats now and recurrence and you know we helped her out with

658
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:54,080
setting up the registry and helped her her husband did it with her and in her friend Katie and

659
01:02:54,640 --> 01:03:00,240
who's my melanoma world if you follow her on Instagram she's great has great info and we set that up

660
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:05,760
we put as a registry the week we promoted it and within the week she got over seven thousand

661
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:12,400
dollars donated and all the things in the registry and it's just letting people know you know
