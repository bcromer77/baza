1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I feel like with adult friendships, you at least,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,600
you pretty much know right away

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,960
whether it's someone that you're going to be close with.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,160
It doesn't take 20 hangouts to get there.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,040
And you're also not like drinking at a bar,

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,200
not really talking about life.

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,960
Yeah, like you're having deep conversations

8
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,160
pretty much up front.

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,440
Hey everyone, welcome back.

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,280
Hello, hello, and happy new week.

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,320
Happy new week, guys.

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,760
We're so excited that you're joining us again

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,920
and we're gonna do a little catch-up

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,640
and then get into our topic for the day.

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,000
Sounds good, let's do it.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,640
Alex, why don't you tell us, how is your week going?

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,940
It's going a lot better now.

18
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,520
At the beginning of the week,

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,240
I definitely was having a really hard time

20
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,620
with prednisone, just like batting anxiety,

21
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,080
not sleeping well.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,800
And so I just kind of like took a couple of days

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,000
to be not on my phone as much, hello, Knox.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,480
Do some re-nox-ing.

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,360
Be outside.

26
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,960
And I think that that's helped a lot,

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,120
just having some quiet time.

28
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,440
Yeah, and still on a flare-up waiting for IV,

29
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,920
or waiting for Rotexin to get approved and start that.

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,280
So anxious to start that, but ready.

31
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,080
I feel ready to go.

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,480
Yeah, so for people that don't know,

33
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,440
so prednisone is a steroid.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,720
It has really gnarly side effects.

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,880
I have heard when I was taking it,

36
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,800
it's called like the devil's tic-tac or devil's candy.

37
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,520
It just makes you feel kind of nutty.

38
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,400
Like actually psychotic.

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,840
Yeah, and not like yourself.

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,760
Does that resonate with you?

41
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,360
Like you're feeling out of sorts.

42
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,400
Very out of sorts, heightened anxiety,

43
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,080
heightened emotional-ness and sensitivity.

44
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,760
I get like kind of paranoid, honestly, when I'm on it,

45
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,480
where I think like everyone's upset with me,

46
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,080
or that like I'm dropping the ball on,

47
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,160
just like hyper self-critical.

48
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,040
And then you don't sleep, which exacerbates all of that.

49
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,960
You get really hungry, you gain weight,

50
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,240
it makes your body swell.

51
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,080
Yeah.

52
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,920
I mean, it helps.

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,760
It works.

54
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,880
It works, it just, it comes out of bit cost.

55
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,080
Yeah, when I was on it, I gained a ton of weight.

56
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,560
Like I was eating ice cream on the daily,

57
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,960
and not just like regular ice cream,

58
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,240
like a whole like ice cream sundae with like syrup

59
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,840
and nuts and all this stuff on it.

60
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,400
Whipped cream on it.

61
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,880
So I totally get it.

62
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,240
You have to treat yourself

63
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,920
when you're on that medication, you know?

64
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,200
Yeah, I feel like at that point,

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,160
you're like anything that makes you feel better,

66
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,200
you'll have it.

67
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,040
I think so.

68
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,120
How long do you have to stay on it?

69
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,920
Probably a couple months.

70
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,680
So like for autoimmune stuff,

71
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,640
you can go on, there's a couple of different things

72
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,480
that you can do for steroids.

73
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,560
You can get like IV-solumedrol,

74
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,280
which is usually like if you're inpatient

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,440
or in the ER, they'll give you that.

76
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,320
So when I was in my last hospitalization, I did that.

77
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,480
You can get intramuscular like IM shots of it

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,440
or shots directly into like nodules or vasculitis.

79
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,960
Those I prefer because it's in your body

80
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,080
and out really quick.

81
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,160
And then you have like the oral prednisone,

82
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,480
which is systemic for flare ups

83
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,360
that can range anywhere between like 20 to 80 milligrams

84
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,560
per day.

85
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,600
I'm at 40, which is like a pretty hefty dose.

86
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

87
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,680
That's, I think you're just gonna have to let it

88
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,000
ride out and see.

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,520
And hopefully, I mean, I think more than anything,

90
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,120
it's just going to be, you know,

91
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,400
the fact that it's like effective

92
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,000
and that you end up internally healing.

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,720
Yeah.

94
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,060
How, what else is going on?

95
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,800
Do you feel like you're getting support

96
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,640
the way you need?

97
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,800
How is that going?

98
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,200
Yeah, I think this has been like,

99
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,480
I'm really grateful for Cooper

100
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,480
because he is so calming to me during this period.

101
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,880
Maybe like a funny little trick

102
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,320
that we do with prednisone.

103
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,280
When I am in like a heightened state

104
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,160
and I start to become kind of snippy

105
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,120
or like my tone is not great,

106
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,640
we have a code word and it's Victor,

107
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,060
he goes, hey, Victoria.

108
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,960
And that is me recognizing that my alter ego,

109
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,520
my prednisone ego is out and being feisty.

110
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,560
That's so funny.

111
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,120
And it kind of like lightens the mood.

112
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,760
It allows, it lets me know that he's giving me grace

113
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,960
right now and to like check myself.

114
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,320
And then I'm just like trying to be more communicative

115
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,840
with like my friends and family saying like,

116
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,400
I'm super anxious right now.

117
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,720
I need extra like love and support and like patience.

118
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,400
And I feel like that's been super helpful to you.

119
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,240
Good.

120
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,560
Yeah.

121
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,640
Do you feel like you get a lot of people asking you like,

122
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,880
so like, are you better now?

123
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,760
Like, how are you feeling?

124
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,720
Are you like, are you out of the slump of this?

125
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,560
Yeah.

126
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,800
And I'm like kind of split on how I feel about that.

127
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,840
Half of it, and maybe this is the prednisone,

128
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,120
half of it, I get like super frustrated, sad, angry of like,

129
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,960
no, like I haven't started my new medicine yet.

130
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,800
Yeah.

131
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,000
Like I still feel like, shit, this is a chronic illness.

132
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,680
Like I'm never going to be a hundred percent better.

133
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,360
And then the other part of me is like,

134
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,880
oh, like my circle cares about me

135
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,480
and like they want me to be feeling better.

136
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,480
And I have to like really remind myself

137
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,160
that people have good intent.

138
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,560
It's not to be like,

139
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,840
that they don't understand chronic illnesses

140
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,600
or autoimmune diseases and how they ebb and flow.

141
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,200
It's them caring and checking in,

142
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,840
but just asking in a way that on a certain hour or day,

143
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,760
might rub me the wrong way.

144
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,600
Yeah.

145
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,440
What about you?

146
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,280
How do you deal with that?

147
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,200
I think it's a tough one, right?

148
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,720
Because I think people are coming from a good place,

149
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,720
but I think when people say like, are you better now?

150
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,280
I think that one bothers me.

151
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,160
I think I'm more so just like the questions

152
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,720
that are like, how's today going?

153
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,880
Yeah, open-ended.

154
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,520
Yeah, like leave it open-ended and then let me be like,

155
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,040
yeah, like it's better than yesterday

156
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,480
or no, I'm feeling worse.

157
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,400
Like kind of just like a comparing day-to-day

158
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,240
versus like comparing like I'm better overall.

159
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,200
I totally agree.

160
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,120
Cause I think when you say like, are you better?

161
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,320
It doesn't give us space to actually tell the person

162
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,600
how we're feeling and whether intended or not,

163
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,440
it kind of shuts down the conversation of like,

164
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,040
this person only wants me to be better.

165
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,880
Like maybe that's the only version of me

166
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,680
they can interact with.

167
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,440
And I think that can be really disappointing and tough.

168
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,280
Yeah, I agree.

169
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,160
And I think a simple thing that I just realized

170
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,000
like a yes or no question is really tough

171
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and can feel triggering.

172
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,920
And a open-ended question feels a lot more welcoming

173
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,640
for us to share how we're feeling.

174
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,960
I totally agree.

175
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,240
My mom once told me this like,

176
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,760
I love when people say, walk me through your day.

177
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,280
Cause then you like can really open up

178
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,420
and like let yourself be vulnerable

179
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,180
with that friend, person, whatever.

180
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,900
And it's better for both parties.

181
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,740
Yeah, I like that.

182
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,220
I also like walk me through your week, right?

183
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,780
Because it's like maybe like today was hard,

184
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,940
but like yesterday was good.

185
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,860
So I feel like when I, when people ask me like,

186
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,220
how's your week been?

187
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,180
That's easier for me to be like, yeah, like Monday, Tuesday,

188
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,980
I wasn't feeling well, I was really low.

189
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,940
And then like, then I was up and about.

190
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,580
So it makes me feel a lot more,

191
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,020
like it seems like the week is a more comprehensive way

192
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,660
to describe how I'm doing versus the day-to-day.

193
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,500
I love that.

194
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,300
And then you don't have the pressure of like,

195
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,700
man, am I complaining again that today's been a bad one?

196
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,540
Yeah.

197
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,020
Which we all hate having to do and say,

198
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,380
even if that is the reality.

199
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,300
Yeah, totally.

200
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,140
Yeah.

201
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,980
How about you?

202
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,940
How's everything been since coming back from your retreat?

203
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,340
I got back just like a couple of days ago

204
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,780
and I'm headed back out in a couple of days.

205
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,860
That being said, I'm really like enjoying

206
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,740
these few days at home.

207
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,100
So like I went to the farmer's market and then I cooked

208
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,140
and I've been just like kind of nesting at home,

209
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,340
but also busy like running some errands,

210
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,620
getting all my doctor's appointments

211
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,620
and getting all of my refills for my medicines,

212
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,420
making sure I have everything for my trip coming up.

213
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,260
So important.

214
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,500
And, but also I think one of the big things I've been doing

215
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,620
since I've been home is like continuing to meditate,

216
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,340
continuing to like employ the teachings from the retreat.

217
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,780
And so that's been really nice.

218
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,820
I feel like my couple of days at home,

219
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,380
like pre-retreat would have felt a lot more stressful.

220
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,860
And now I'm kind of just in this like Zen state

221
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,140
and just like filled with gratitude,

222
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,780
not to sound cheesy, but I feel-

223
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,100
No, that's amazing.

224
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,180
I feel like just grateful and happy, which is really nice.

225
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,020
That's amazing.

226
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,020
What has been the easiest part of like the things

227
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,580
that you learned to reintegrate

228
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,260
and what has been like more effort

229
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,020
or a little bit more challenging

230
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,660
than you would have anticipated?

231
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,900
I think one of the easier things, which is interesting

232
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,060
because I would think it's harder to incorporate

233
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,540
is like getting up early

234
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,900
and meditating first thing in the morning.

235
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,780
We learned at the retreat, like you're more,

236
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,540
like you're most likely to be in like that theta brain state

237
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,820
that you, brainwave that you need to be in for meditation

238
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,260
in the morning hours of like four to five AM.

239
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,100
That makes sense.

240
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,500
And it's so theta brainwaves, just a reminder.

241
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,740
It's like, you have those like right before you fall asleep

242
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,860
and then right after you're waking up.

243
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,580
So it's like that kind of in between state

244
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,860
of like consciousness and consciousness.

245
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,700
Got it.

246
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,100
And so it's easier to get your mind into theta

247
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,780
when you're in those early hours.

248
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,460
So incorporating that has actually been the easiest

249
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,900
because I'm just like, okay, like I know

250
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,940
that's like when it's optimal.

251
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,700
And I'm just going to set an alarm and get up

252
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,780
and do my meditations.

253
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,540
And then I can always take a nap later.

254
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,620
That's been the easiest.

255
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,380
The hardest has actually been doing my gratitude journal,

256
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,580
which I normally do.

257
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,660
I think I'm like, I wake up and I'm so excited

258
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,820
to do the meditation that I skip that part.

259
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,340
And I think that's important to keep still doing

260
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,620
because I think that also brings a lot of benefits.

261
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,460
Totally.

262
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,860
And it helps guide my day.

263
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,260
And I think I'm gonna,

264
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,580
I just need to prioritize doing that first thing.

265
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,420
Yeah.

266
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,340
I wonder if it would be good to do like after your meditation.

267
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,380
Like that's how you end your transition

268
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,740
from meditative state into normal day.

269
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,580
Yeah.

270
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,420
I can try that.

271
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,260
Yeah.

272
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,100
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

273
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,940
You're doing great.

274
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,500
Like the fact that you're waking up early and meditating,

275
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,260
that's truly goals, sick chick goals.

276
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,100
Yeah.

277
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,940
It's really nice.

278
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,740
The afternoon or late morning naps are also really nice.

279
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,380
I'm gonna try to take a page out of your book

280
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,780
next week and like do one day, see how it goes.

281
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,620
Yeah.

282
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,740
I mean, hell, I'm on prednisone.

283
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,700
So Lord knows when I'm awake, I'm awake.

284
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,780
Yeah.

285
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,140
Yeah.

286
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,980
Okay.

287
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,380
So last week we sent out like a Q and A to you guys

288
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,900
and said, what topics are you guys interested in?

289
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,260
Biz and I exploring a bit more.

290
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,620
And we got great feedback.

291
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,420
We're super excited to talk about each of the things

292
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,740
that you guys want us to.

293
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,620
One of the main ones was all things relationships

294
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,060
be that family, friends, coworkers, dating, marriage.

295
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,620
So this week we thought we'd dive in

296
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,220
and focus on friendships and social life as a sick chick.

297
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,060
Yes.

298
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,900
Let's do it.

299
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,740
Okay.

300
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,020
So maybe let's set the stage as we do.

301
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,140
Socializing before, what was your social life, Biz?

302
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,340
Or were you introverted, extroverted,

303
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,220
kind of describe that aspect?

304
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,060
Yeah.

305
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,020
So when I used to take those like personality tests

306
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,620
that we would do in business school

307
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,900
and like in the workplace,

308
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,340
like Meyer Briggs is one of them

309
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,780
that you can do like a shorter version online of.

310
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:36,180
But I was like literally like the most extreme extrovert.

311
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,780
Like there was, it was like 100% on the E

312
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,220
of that four letter acronym.

313
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,980
And so I would say it was probably

314
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,980
in that high extrovert stage from like ages like 20 to like 30.

315
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,500
Actually, no, that's not true.

316
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,380
Probably up until like last year or so.

317
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,220
Yeah.

318
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,500
Like I would say for the last like 15 years or so,

319
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,820
I've definitely been like high extrovert

320
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,460
and super social, like you could invite me to anything

321
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,180
and I would come, I wouldn't even ask like

322
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,260
who's gonna be there, what are we doing?

323
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,100
Yes, girl.

324
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,140
I would just show up and then I'd be like

325
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,540
the last person to leave, which is so ridiculous

326
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,780
now that I've think back about it.

327
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,740
But I just had this like social battery

328
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,180
that everything was fun.

329
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,500
And I just wanted to be around people all the time.

330
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,900
Yeah, that's so true.

331
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,140
Like when we would hang out,

332
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,420
it would be until four in the morning.

333
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,180
We'd just stay up talking.

334
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,700
There was no off.

335
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,380
People would message me and be like, oh, I'm really tired.

336
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,580
Like how do you, how do you like do that all the time?

337
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,380
I'm like, oh, I'm fine.

338
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,900
It recharges your battery.

339
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,260
Yeah, exactly.

340
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,100
So yeah, I would say highly social, highly outgoing

341
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,740
and ready like down to do, to go anywhere and do anything.

342
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,540
Yeah, I think that that is definitely true for you.

343
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,220
How is it for you?

344
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,300
I would say pre-college, I was more introverted.

345
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,820
I'd like doing like one or two social things a week,

346
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,260
but being involved in like clubs and activities

347
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,520
from college through investment banking.

348
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,820
I was also a yes girl, like always wanted to go out,

349
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,220
wanted to travel, whatever it was, like count me out there.

350
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,300
And then after banking, when I started getting sick,

351
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,660
that's when my transition kind of back

352
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,460
to being more introverted started, I think.

353
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:27,500
And like I get charged up definitely from like a long time,

354
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,300
but I am also very extroverted or can be really extroverted.

355
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,660
So I'm kind of like a split person, I would say.

356
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,500
Do you think that's true?

357
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,660
Yeah, I think that's true.

358
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,180
I think like around certain people,

359
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,900
like I think when, when we hang out,

360
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,700
like we will still have like our full hangouts.

361
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,860
Yes, but I can't do that with everyone.

362
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,580
That's pretty, I'm sure.

363
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,420
I agree.

364
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,140
I think that's definitely like that split part.

365
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,660
But I think, I mean, so kind of like pivoting into like,

366
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,700
like how did we, or like what was the switch for us?

367
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,340
Like I think one thing is like,

368
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,060
it's kind of that like when you're straddling that in between

369
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,180
of like, okay, like I can do certain things

370
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,660
with certain people, but then like, you know,

371
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,700
certain other things.

372
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,980
I'm like, oh, I don't know if I have enough

373
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,460
like social battery for that.

374
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,980
Yes, absolutely.

375
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,740
And part of that is just like,

376
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,020
I think there's lots of different aspects

377
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,700
of why that happens.

378
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,660
Yeah.

379
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,020
One of those is like your identity is shifting

380
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,220
and it's harder, it gets harder and harder

381
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,340
to relate to people that can't step

382
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,180
into that new space with you, I think.

383
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,020
Yeah.

384
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,340
And so, you know, if you're like,

385
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,380
Biz and I are very like high empaths

386
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,740
and being disingenuine or like trying to put on a mask

387
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,580
or be this other person is really challenging

388
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,220
and very socially draining.

389
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,060
Yeah.

390
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,740
So I think that was like one of the main sticking points

391
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,500
is I remember like this as I got more sick

392
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,540
and as I started identifying as being sick,

393
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,140
I stopped being able to relate

394
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,860
to some of my friends at the time.

395
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,140
And we've talked about this before,

396
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,460
but like I was so young when I got diagnosed,

397
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,100
like with vasculitis at least,

398
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,860
that my friend group hadn't shifted

399
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,420
or evolved from my college drinking friends.

400
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,100
So there were, it was like kind of this compounded time period

401
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,940
in my life.

402
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,420
Yeah, that makes sense.

403
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,260
Yeah.

404
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,740
I think for me, like when I, so when I got diagnosed

405
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,380
and I was in the hospital for that month-ish,

406
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,020
that was like, like that in itself like

407
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,500
was a resetting period, right?

408
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
So it was like, okay, I'm not gonna be going out

409
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,860
doing the things I was normally doing.

410
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,020
Yes.

411
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,140
And then I think when I got discharged,

412
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,620
like that's where it started for me.

413
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,140
I started noticing that being around the people,

414
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,900
like when they would come visit me,

415
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,340
like it just felt very different.

416
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,140
And then when I did start like going out

417
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,540
and doing, you know, more things again,

418
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,020
I just felt kind of like, like quiet.

419
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,460
I felt more isolated.

420
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,860
I felt like I couldn't contribute

421
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,260
to the conversations as much anymore.

422
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,700
And that was like kind of the circle of like,

423
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,520
okay, like I go to something, I'm kind of quiet.

424
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,100
Then it like makes me not want to go to something again.

425
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,420
And then I started like becoming a little bit isolated.

426
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,260
Yeah.

427
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,060
And I think to your point,

428
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,140
it's like just having different priorities

429
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,980
or like it's like,

430
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,100
I don't want to go out to a loud restaurant anymore.

431
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,380
Like I don't want to be going out,

432
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,980
staying out till like midnight, 1 a.m.

433
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,540
And, you know, the friends that do that

434
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,780
and still, you know, live their life like that.

435
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,980
Like I think that's great, but I just can't,

436
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,980
it's just not something that like I really can do anymore.

437
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,820
Absolutely.

438
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,380
And I think out of that group,

439
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,580
there's only select people that are willing

440
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:44,020
and like want to make that shift for you and be like,

441
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,820
okay, well, since you don't want to go and do this

442
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,980
or you slash you can't,

443
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,220
how can we hang out in a different way?

444
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,060
And those are like,

445
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,820
those are the real people that we love.

446
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,380
Those are awesome human beings.

447
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,700
And totally, like not knocking anybody

448
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,380
for like socializing like that at all.

449
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,300
It's just like we physically cannot.

450
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,500
I have also learned that like the friends

451
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,900
that like did show up in like the more like

452
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,300
home settings for me, they've all kind of said,

453
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,780
they're like, oh, like we like this.

454
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,060
Like we actually like to like do things like this.

455
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,020
So that's been really nice that, you know,

456
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,900
they were like, look,

457
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,820
they were looking for like a way out as well.

458
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,660
Yeah.

459
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,780
And this kind of gave them like a way out to be like,

460
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,540
okay, like let's hang out at home more.

461
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,820
I totally agree with that.

462
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,660
And, and like what you're saying,

463
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,180
those are probably the split people anyway that.

464
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,220
Yeah.

465
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,660
We're putting on the mask to be able to go out still

466
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,340
and do the all the happy hours

467
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,460
or go to a loud restaurant till late in the night.

468
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,580
And they really were just craving something like this.

469
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,100
So that's totally a silver lining.

470
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,020
We get to be the out for a lot of people.

471
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,300
Yeah, totally.

472
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,660
How did you internally feel when you had to start

473
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,140
like turning down plans or making that shift

474
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,340
in your identity?

475
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,420
So guilty.

476
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,260
Oh my God.

477
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,180
And that was not just internal, but external too.

478
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:05,180
Like I had two or three friends in Austin that, you know,

479
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,900
maybe I would cancel morning of something

480
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,660
and they were never for like one on one thing.

481
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,020
So it's usually for like group hangouts.

482
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,860
Right.

483
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,220
Which should be an easy out anyways.

484
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,140
Agreed.

485
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,220
And these people just were really tough on me

486
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,100
and would say like, you're such a flake,

487
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,540
you're a bad friend because you don't show up

488
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,060
to this stuff for us and XYZ.

489
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,940
So it was, I had this already internal pressure of,

490
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,100
am I being a bad friend?

491
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,500
Granted, I also was on prednisone.

492
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,580
So like double whammy of internalizing being hard

493
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,620
on myself and then I had these voices external

494
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,460
echoing that.

495
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,180
And so I was really like down and sad and out

496
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,620
for about a year where I didn't have new friends

497
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,340
that were stepping in as much.

498
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,860
And I was essentially breaking up with this group of friends

499
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,140
that not only we're not showing up for my health,

500
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,580
but we're making me feel bad about my health.

501
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,260
And it extended beyond just you're not showing up,

502
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,860
but giving me a hard time about like how,

503
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,740
who I was as a person, which was tough.

504
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,860
I think that's really tough.

505
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,300
And just hearing you even say that it's just,

506
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,180
it's like you weren't showing up to like a happy hour

507
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,460
or like going out to eat or like going out for drinks.

508
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,780
Like you weren't like,

509
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,140
it wasn't something serious that you weren't there for.

510
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,060
It was just like the socializing.

511
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:32,820
And so I think that in itself is just, I think wrong.

512
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,740
If you aren't able to make it to a social event,

513
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,980
like it's totally okay to be like,

514
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,500
hey, I can't come because of X, Y and Z.

515
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,500
And like you actually have a legit reason.

516
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,420
It's not like you're canceling because you're hanging out

517
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,980
with other friends or you're doing something else

518
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,980
that's using that energy.

519
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,740
You're literally trying to like stay at home

520
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,340
and rest and recuperate.

521
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:56,180
And it's just, I think it's wrong to shame someone

522
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,780
or make them feel guilty when they're sick

523
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,980
and they can't come to something.

524
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,820
I agree.

525
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,100
And at that point, I didn't have a diagnosis yet either,

526
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,040
which I think further exacerbated it

527
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,980
because people would think like, are you being lazy?

528
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,980
Like what's wrong with you?

529
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,300
And being chronically ill.

530
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,940
I had days where I looked and felt normal.

531
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,060
And then days where I wouldn't.

532
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:22,060
And that like dichotomy there was really hard

533
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,140
for my friends at that time to understand,

534
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,180
which looking back, I'm like, that's really lame.

535
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,380
Google, just Google something, read something

536
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,260
because that's not just me.

537
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,980
Or ask me, yeah.

538
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,260
And they never asked.

539
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,060
They wouldn't check in on me, wouldn't anything.

540
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,420
Looking back, like they were just super immature

541
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:48,420
and not great friends or just were more focused on socializing.

542
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,420
Yeah.

543
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,060
And I think like what you, like there are friends

544
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,020
that are just there for like the good times

545
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,460
and they're not there for you really.

546
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,700
And it of course sucks when you realize that.

547
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,220
It's not to say like those people

548
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,740
you have to cut out of your life,

549
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,380
but that was my main friend group.

550
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,300
And so it was either I'm gonna be mentally beat up

551
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,260
and emotionally beat up all the time by this group

552
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,820
or I'm gonna make changes in my life

553
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,240
and maybe be lonely and not have that many friends

554
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,940
for a while and make new friends.

555
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,020
And that's the direction that I ended up going.

556
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,860
Yeah.

557
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,380
I also will say like, there's nothing more isolating

558
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,820
and feeling lonely than like being in like a group hangout

559
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,380
and feeling like no one's getting it.

560
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,140
Like no one's getting what you're going through.

561
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,980
Yeah.

562
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,060
Have you had experiences like that?

563
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,340
Yeah, actually I feel like, I mean,

564
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,460
I feel like I still have them,

565
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,380
but definitely like more so in the beginning

566
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,340
when I like really wasn't feeling well

567
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,820
and I wasn't sure how to manage not feeling well.

568
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,220
I would still like, or like when people had come over

569
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,740
or like we'd go out somewhere,

570
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,220
I just felt like I couldn't relate.

571
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,580
And I felt like, they were all carrying on and having fun.

572
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,500
And I think on, I think their intent was like,

573
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
well, we want this to be fun for you.

574
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,100
So we don't wanna talk about what's happening.

575
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,260
Like we want this to be a distraction for you.

576
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,340
Absolutely.

577
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,260
Which I don't think is like a bad thing,

578
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,900
but I think what I was needing at that time

579
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,740
was people to talk about it with me.

580
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,300
And I think even now, I think the people,

581
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,980
the friends that I'm the closest to

582
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,300
are the people who really talk to me

583
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,500
about what I'm going through

584
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,100
and not just try to distract me.

585
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,300
Absolutely.

586
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,420
I think I don't,

587
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,860
I just don't think I'm this type of person

588
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,580
who needs distractions.

589
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,500
Like I wanna be real and authentic

590
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,780
and I wanna talk about all the things.

591
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,460
And you'll say when you want a distraction.

592
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,700
I think that is like one of the hardest parts

593
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,540
or like maybe the like tipping point

594
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:50,540
of all of this friendship conversation is communication.

595
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,340
And so like if, at the beginning,

596
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,420
we might not have the words to be able to express

597
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,540
or say what we need.

598
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,260
And so just asking,

599
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,340
hey, do you want a distraction?

600
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,740
If you wanna talk about this is a game changer and huge.

601
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,580
Yeah.

602
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,420
Versus trying to think like,

603
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,100
oh, what would I want in this situation?

604
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,940
Because we're all different.

605
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,580
Like what you want might not be what we want.

606
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,500
Right.

607
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,340
I totally agree.

608
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,020
I think it's like being able to like communicate

609
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,620
to your friends and your family.

610
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,780
And like even if like,

611
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,820
let's say they're being supportive

612
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,940
and they're talking about it with you,

613
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,620
but you hit a point where you're like,

614
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,060
okay, now I'm done talking about it.

615
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,620
I wanna just like hang out now.

616
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,140
It's totally fine, thanks guys.

617
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,540
I'm so glad we talked about that.

618
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,380
Like let's kind of just like talk about this now.

619
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,220
Yeah, totally.

620
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,220
And I think when I've done that in the past,

621
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,580
like people are like, okay, great.

622
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,580
Like let's, you know,

623
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,060
they're really honestly like down for whatever.

624
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,340
You just have to let them know for the most part.

625
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,220
And it feels so awkward at the start when you do that,

626
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,420
but the benefits are 10 fold.

627
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,980
You get more comfortable doing it

628
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,940
and people are super receptive to it.

629
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,740
So at the end of the day, it's a benefit for everybody.

630
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,580
Yeah.

631
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,820
I think a lot of people don't know what to do.

632
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,940
And so I think guidance is nice.

633
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,220
And you know, just help them out a little bit.

634
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,060
Yeah.

635
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,660
Nobody can read our minds.

636
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,260
It sucks having to be the one that educates,

637
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,940
but it's for your best interests

638
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,180
to put in the time and to do that.

639
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,020
Totally.

640
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,940
Okay, let's talk about like how making plans

641
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,220
and canceling plans and the friendship game

642
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,860
is when you're chronically sick.

643
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,080
I think for me, for the most part,

644
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,100
people have been understanding.

645
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,100
I think what's, I think the canceling plans

646
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,180
is still awkward for some reason.

647
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:45,180
Some people still feel like entitled to your time

648
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,460
if you've committed to something.

649
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,300
Yes.

650
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,460
And so it's, you know, it's like we,

651
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,060
like I could wake up in the morning

652
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,140
and know that like by the evening,

653
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,580
I'm not going to be feeling well.

654
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,420
Yes.

655
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,780
But I could also wake up in the morning and be okay

656
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,420
and think that when 7 p.m. rolls around, I'll be okay.

657
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,060
But things change throughout the day.

658
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,900
Yes.

659
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:13,300
It's, I think a last minute canceling should be respected

660
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,820
and okay from someone who's chronically ill.

661
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,340
Yeah.

662
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,660
I want to say like the buffers like two hours before,

663
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,100
like before someone leaves their house,

664
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,620
it's probably good to give them a heads up.

665
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,460
Totally.

666
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,800
Yeah, I think like before someone starts like getting ready

667
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,340
for whatever you're doing, give them a heads up.

668
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,500
And I think at that point, like you're giving them

669
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,860
enough of a notice that it should be okay.

670
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,580
Like they should be able to survive their evening

671
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,100
or hang out without you.

672
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,940
Yeah.

673
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,380
And if they don't have plans then for the night,

674
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,340
like is that worse or is it worse

675
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,580
that your friend who's chronically sick,

676
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,660
you want them to push through everything,

677
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,900
be in pain, be uncomfortable and hang out with you?

678
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,740
Yeah.

679
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,580
I think that's what's important

680
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,900
to keep in the back of the mind that like,

681
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,740
yeah, canceling sucks for everybody,

682
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,580
but there's a reason why that sick person is canceling.

683
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,380
And I don't think you wanna see

684
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,340
what that reason looks like probably.

685
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,140
I think another thing with canceling for me,

686
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:13,140
I find it less stressful when the person doesn't respond

687
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,180
with like, okay, let's reschedule.

688
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,540
I think that's also hard.

689
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,900
It's like, I couldn't make it today.

690
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,620
I don't exactly know when I'm gonna be feeling better.

691
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,460
And so I think just leaving it open ended

692
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,940
and just being like, okay,

693
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,780
we'll figure something out another time.

694
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,100
Like just, it's probably not the right time

695
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,540
to nail down another hangout.

696
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,620
I totally agree.

697
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,740
And maybe it's the right time to be like,

698
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,020
I'm so sorry, like, is there anything I can do?

699
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,740
It seems like you're going through something right now.

700
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,580
Yeah.

701
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,700
Or like just like a totally understand,

702
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,900
no worries at all.

703
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,260
Take care of yourself.

704
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,100
Take care of yourself.

705
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,780
Hope you feel better soon.

706
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,620
I'm here for you.

707
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,460
Absolutely.

708
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,100
I think that that's like the perfect way to do it.

709
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,180
The perfect way to do it.

710
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,740
I think less questions and more just like loving statements.

711
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,580
Yeah.

712
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,180
We just wanna be loved.

713
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,020
Yeah.

714
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:04,300
Oh, but it is tricky and it is sad.

715
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,540
And being a sick trick,

716
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,100
like you do miss out on a lot of things,

717
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,420
be that travel, weddings, baby showers, stuff like that.

718
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,260
I think at this point,

719
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,260
I've missed 10 of my friends' weddings.

720
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,060
And it doesn't get easier anytime.

721
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,900
It's still heartbreaking that you're missing out

722
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,720
on these like big life moments,

723
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,020
not even just like the Friday night or Saturday night hang.

724
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,860
Yeah.

725
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,940
And I think when like those invades come in,

726
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,460
that's when the anxiety starts of,

727
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,700
damn, I really hope I'm gonna be able to do this

728
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,540
in six months in a year.

729
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,380
Yeah.

730
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,420
Yeah, it's tough.

731
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,140
I luckily haven't had to miss like major things like that.

732
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,900
I think that would feel a lot more disheartening.

733
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,940
That being said, I mean, I can probably look back now

734
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,220
and be like, oh, I probably shouldn't have gone

735
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,820
to that big event.

736
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,980
Yes.

737
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,940
So maybe I should have probably missed out on those things,

738
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,300
but I think, I don't know,

739
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,660
there's something about like pushing yourself a little bit

740
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,340
when it is something important,

741
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,660
but just kind of understand like,

742
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,700
I'm probably not gonna feel good after this,

743
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,020
but I'm willing to like take that risk

744
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,580
because this is so important to me.

745
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,860
And then I think on the flip side,

746
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,500
like if you do have to miss like your friend's wedding,

747
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,900
et cetera, like hopefully that friend's like a good enough

748
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,020
friend that understands it and doesn't hold it against you.

749
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,860
A hundred percent.

750
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,180
And I've had split.

751
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,020
I know you've had,

752
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,700
I know you've had a split experience with that.

753
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,660
I've had the best experience of week of,

754
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,940
hey, I'm not gonna be able to make this.

755
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,060
I'm in a really bad spot.

756
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,500
If I get on that plane,

757
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,580
I'm gonna be in the hospital.

758
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,460
And like I will 10 times out of 10,

759
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:43,420
choose stay home versus hospitalization,

760
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,140
setting myself up for that.

761
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,980
Because either way you're missing the event.

762
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,100
Yeah, yeah.

763
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,940
Right?

764
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,100
And so the friends that respond with,

765
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,460
oh my gosh, I love you.

766
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,820
I'm so sorry.

767
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,980
Of course, like do what's right for you.

768
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,940
That feels really good.

769
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,300
And then the friend, like I just had to miss my friend's

770
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,100
wedding in Cabo because I was in the hospital.

771
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,860
And when they came back,

772
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,140
they like drove to our house.

773
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,140
They brought me flowers for being in the hospital.

774
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,580
And then like we looked through all of their wedding photos,

775
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,780
watched their first dance,

776
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,580
like made us be able to relive those moments with them.

777
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,500
And still we're like, we love you.

778
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,620
You're sick right now.

779
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,940
And like we also care about that.

780
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,580
It was really, really special.

781
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,420
Exactly.

782
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,340
And it's like, let's say like,

783
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,900
you didn't hear from that friend again.

784
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,780
It's like, well, why were you,

785
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,900
like why were you sacrificing your health

786
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,580
to go to this person's wedding who doesn't care?

787
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,340
Doesn't even care about you actually.

788
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,580
Yeah.

789
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,780
Maybe I'll share that story.

790
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,980
Should I do it?

791
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,820
Yeah, let's do it.

792
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,660
Okay.

793
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,740
This is the bad one.

794
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,620
I mean, it's good for us listening.

795
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,460
It is.

796
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,780
So this is like truly the worst case scenario

797
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,140
of what can happen.

798
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,500
I was friends with this girl.

799
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,180
She was in my wedding.

800
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,260
I was going to be in her wedding.

801
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,500
And throughout her engagement year,

802
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,220
I started to get sick again.

803
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,580
And, you know, I think it was like that fall,

804
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,980
I had two bachelorette parties I was supposed to go to.

805
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:11,020
The first one I missed and I was really sad.

806
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:15,580
I sent champagne to the group and whatnot.

807
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,060
That also impacted that friendship,

808
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,820
kind of has fizzled out a bit.

809
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,020
I think it was because like I could do other things

810
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,700
that weekend, but couldn't fly.

811
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,060
And there was a misunderstanding of like why I couldn't fly.

812
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,140
But the, was there some sort of question,

813
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,900
like you were able to fly for this

814
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,180
and now you can't fly for this?

815
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,340
Exactly.

816
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,180
Yeah, exactly.

817
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,100
So when I went to this other girl's bachelorette party,

818
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,340
then I think it made the other girl mad

819
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,580
that I couldn't come to hers.

820
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,340
Which is understandable, but from an outsider's perspective,

821
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,500
but from a sick chick perspective, it's like duh,

822
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,580
I didn't feel good that weekend.

823
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,620
And I felt better by the other weekend.

824
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,460
And they were months apart.

825
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,460
Yeah, it's kind of consistent.

826
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,820
No, so for the really bad story,

827
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,420
I go to this girl's bachelorette party.

828
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,220
I push through, I don't use my cane during it.

829
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,140
I have like two or three glasses of wine

830
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,540
throughout the weekend.

831
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,980
By the end of the weekend, I was so fucking tired.

832
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,940
I almost missed the last dinner.

833
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,380
I got home and slept for a week.

834
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,140
I started prednisone again

835
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,980
and I could just feel like, shit,

836
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,660
I think a hospitalization might be imminent.

837
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,500
Right.

838
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,940
But I kept trying to push through and push through.

839
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,340
And then it was her wedding coming up to her wedding.

840
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,180
Yeah.

841
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:36,180
And I had lost probably, when I bought my dress

842
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,460
to wear for her wedding, I was losing prednisone weight.

843
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,060
So I was probably like 30, 40 pounds heavier.

844
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,900
Yep.

845
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,220
At the point of her wedding, I was tiny

846
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,380
and the dress did not fit.

847
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,980
And she would text me every single week,

848
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,740
like, hey, have you gotten your dress hemmed?

849
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,220
Hey, have you gotten your dress hemmed?

850
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,180
This was a very expensive dress.

851
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,340
And so at that point, I was like,

852
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,700
I'm not gonna hem this dress.

853
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,420
I'm just going to sell it

854
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,420
and buy something that actually fits.

855
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,260
Sure.

856
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,540
So I was kind of punting that ball.

857
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,700
Maybe I should have been more communicative or whatnot.

858
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,900
But that was annoying her.

859
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,220
And then we were talking about, you know,

860
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,740
what the wedding weekend would look like.

861
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:19,740
And I had lost my hair during Cytoxin pretty heavily

862
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,660
and it was growing back in.

863
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,500
Yep.

864
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,340
I did have a wig.

865
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,540
And she said, are you gonna wear your wig

866
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,660
for the wedding or do hair extensions?

867
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,740
And I said, no, I don't think so.

868
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,580
And the fact that-

869
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,740
I don't like that question.

870
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,700
I don't like that question either.

871
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,500
It's like that, you don't get to have any opinion

872
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,940
if I do that.

873
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,340
And asking that's super inappropriate.

874
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,260
Yeah.

875
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,820
So that was the beginning of me being like,

876
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:49,380
why am I, why are you making me feel bad about being sick?

877
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,940
And also like after her Bachelorette party,

878
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,380
she did not text me and say like,

879
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,020
hey, I know that you're having a hard time.

880
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,460
Thanks for pushing through and showing up.

881
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,940
It was, that was expected next story.

882
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,700
The worst part was I said,

883
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,700
hey, I'm having to use my cane more and more

884
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,380
and wheelchairs right now.

885
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,660
I just wanted to give you the heads up,

886
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,700
which I should not have to give someone a heads up

887
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,740
if I'm using a cane or a wheelchair in the first place.

888
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,580
Right.

889
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,340
Her response was, well, you didn't use a cane

890
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,340
at my Bachelorette party,

891
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,780
so I don't think you're gonna have to use one at my wedding.

892
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,940
And it was very apparent that all of these things

893
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,820
that she cared about were for the aesthetic

894
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,340
and the photos and whatnot.

895
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,180
The look.

896
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,220
The look and not, hey, one of my best friends

897
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,500
who I invited to be a bridesmaid

898
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,740
is going through a hard time.

899
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,980
How do I make this easier for her?

900
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,540
It was like all these questions

901
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,700
that made me feel like shit for being sick.

902
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,540
Yeah.

903
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,180
So come the week of her wedding,

904
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,820
I'm being incredibly overly communicative with her,

905
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,300
letting her know like things are going worse,

906
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,500
things are getting worse, things are getting worse.

907
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,460
I end up in the hospital.

908
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,020
And she's like, hey, if you can make the wedding,

909
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:58,620
like I don't care, you can just like sit in the church

910
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,060
and like watch the wedding.

911
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:04,300
You don't have to like sit, be a part of the wedding party.

912
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,700
You don't have to do anything just like,

913
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,020
if you can just show up like that, that's fine.

914
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,340
And I was like, okay, that sounds great.

915
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,180
Which is nice of her.

916
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,500
I think finally like, I mean, a little bit,

917
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,420
I think it was rooted in like,

918
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,460
I don't know if I want you in my pictures.

919
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,380
That being said, she gave you an out at least of,

920
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,900
you know, being able to attend

921
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,300
and not be a part of the bridal party.

922
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,140
Exactly.

923
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,220
So that's nice.

924
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,740
So that was super nice.

925
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,900
But what happened next?

926
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:32,580
So then I'm in the hospital and it's her wedding weekend.

927
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,860
I sent in champagne.

928
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,420
I am texting and I'm like,

929
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,820
I would love to like FaceTime you

930
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,020
while you guys are getting ready.

931
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,460
And she was like, I don't think I'm gonna have time for that.

932
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,160
And there goes the rest of the week.

933
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,180
It's not responding to me.

934
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,380
Not any kind of communication.

935
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,340
Not thank you for the champagne.

936
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,940
Nothing just goes radio silent.

937
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,140
And after her wedding, I was like,

938
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,520
hey, like would love to catch up

939
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,780
and like hear about the wedding.

940
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,180
I'm so sorry I missed it.

941
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,500
This has been a tough hospitalization, blah, blah, blah.

942
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,540
And she's like, I'll get back to you

943
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,020
when I come back for my honeymoon.

944
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,500
I never heard back from her

945
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,300
and have never talked to her since.

946
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,980
You literally like never heard from her again.

947
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,340
Never heard from her again.

948
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,280
That's wild.

949
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,300
And I know it was because I think she thought

950
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,500
I was making her wedding week about myself

951
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
because I had a health crisis going on.

952
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,020
And part of me understands that

953
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,940
cause like you've got a lot going on when you're the bride.

954
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,300
The other part of me is if one of my bridesmaids

955
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,700
was sick during my wedding week,

956
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,240
I would make time and space for them

957
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,740
cause they're one of my best friends.

958
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,580
And be like, I'm sorry.

959
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,260
And if you're chosen and asked to be a bridesmaid

960
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,900
that says a lot about your friendship.

961
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,860
And then it should go both ways.

962
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:51,540
Like if you're unable to partake and do all those things,

963
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,500
like your friends should understand.

964
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,100
And I get it, it's their wedding week

965
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,660
and they're busy and all of that.

966
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:01,380
But at some point later, there should be communication

967
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,300
and like we miss you so much.

968
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,940
And like, how are you feeling?

969
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,860
What's going on?

970
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,700
All those things.

971
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,100
Absolutely.

972
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,500
And like, I don't know.

973
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,140
I would also know that like my bridesmaid would be really sad

974
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,860
and like upset that they couldn't be there.

975
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,380
So I probably would do something

976
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,740
to make them feel a little bit better.

977
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,140
Like send them a picture or FaceTime them

978
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,940
during the wedding weekend at some point to be like,

979
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,220
we miss you, like we're all here.

980
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,740
Send them a video of that or something.

981
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:30,460
But it was just like the most selfish thing

982
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,700
I've ever experienced.

983
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,900
And it made me have a really tough time thinking

984
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,940
like people don't wanna be friends with me because I'm sick

985
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,580
and I can't show up for them in the way

986
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,060
that they need or want.

987
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,860
Which that shouldn't have been how I felt.

988
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,180
It should have been this girl is being really cruel

989
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,460
and you know, caring more about aesthetics

990
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,060
and pictures in herself

991
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,060
than about one of her quote unquote best friends.

992
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,900
Yeah.

993
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,380
I mean, I think for my vantage point,

994
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,500
it's like good riddance.

995
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,020
I think, you know, that friend was never a true friend to you.

996
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,100
Yeah.

997
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,140
Or at least like shifted into someone

998
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,260
who doesn't care about you.

999
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,420
Definitely was a shift.

1000
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,900
Definitely was a shift.

1001
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,540
And part of that too is like twofold.

1002
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,780
When I first started getting sick,

1003
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,940
she was awesome and would show up

1004
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:23,180
and like went above and beyond to make me feel supported.

1005
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,100
Yeah.

1006
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,220
And that was during like my cytoxin period.

1007
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:31,020
Once that ended, I think there was a disconnect of like,

1008
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,980
I'm still sick.

1009
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,740
I'm just not in a disease active state.

1010
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,140
And so I think it was like, oh, I'm gonna have to keep,

1011
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,420
I've set the bar so high of how I show up.

1012
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,560
Do I have to continue this for the rest of my life?

1013
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,940
I don't wanna do that.

1014
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,980
And instead of dropping down a little bit,

1015
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,620
still being there, she just pivoted

1016
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,980
and changed who she was to me.

1017
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,060
Yeah.

1018
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,900
That's awful.

1019
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,900
It was really sad.

1020
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,740
It was really sad.

1021
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,580
Sorry.

1022
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,420
It's okay.

1023
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,780
And then I like, I think the next week missed your wedding

1024
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,220
and you were like, it's okay.

1025
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,060
I love you.

1026
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,900
I miss you.

1027
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,020
I wish that you could have been there too.

1028
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,340
Like, I understand that you're sad.

1029
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,220
You couldn't be there.

1030
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,700
It was a really fun wedding.

1031
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,060
So we definitely missed you.

1032
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:11,900
I know.

1033
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,340
And you looked so freaking pretty.

1034
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,460
Oh my God.

1035
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,300
Thank you.

1036
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,140
The prettiest one.

1037
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:16,980
I think we'll do another one.

1038
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,820
Good.

1039
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,660
Like another party.

1040
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,500
I like that.

1041
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,500
I think wedding should be celebrated annually.

1042
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,620
Yeah.

1043
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,140
Okay.

1044
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,820
So why don't we talk a little bit about like,

1045
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,460
what does socializing look for us now?

1046
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,300
Yes.

1047
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,540
Like, how is it different?

1048
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,460
What are things that we, you know,

1049
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,020
what are changes that we've made?

1050
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,860
It's a great question.

1051
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,500
So I think now it's a couple of things.

1052
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,380
One is I have more confidence in my identity

1053
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,740
as a sick person and I'm no longer embarrassed

1054
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,620
about the things I cannot do.

1055
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:50,260
Like the internalized ableism is getting lessened.

1056
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,220
So I give myself more grace.

1057
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,260
I also understand that some of my health

1058
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,980
might scare other people.

1059
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,980
And I just try to get like a good temperature check

1060
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:04,100
of like how deep and personal do these people want to get.

1061
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,180
And I don't hold that against them.

1062
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,820
It's just like, I know who I can turn to

1063
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,540
for different things.

1064
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,100
And last thing is like how I socialize.

1065
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,620
So I usually do maybe one thing a week

1066
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,660
or one thing every other week.

1067
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,500
Yeah.

1068
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,240
It has, it's time bounded.

1069
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,340
I've gotten really good at the Midwestern.

1070
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:23,300
Oh, well, it looks like it's time to get going.

1071
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:28,300
And that's okay.

1072
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,700
Gotta go check on the chickens.

1073
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,540
Gotta go check on the chickens.

1074
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,860
Cows are moving, so gotta go.

1075
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,900
Yeah.

1076
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,740
That's hilarious.

1077
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,020
And just like lower spoon activity.

1078
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,620
So instead of going bar hopping,

1079
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,980
it's like let's go to dinner for an hour or two hours.

1080
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,020
And then I'll go home.

1081
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,220
What about you?

1082
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,940
What kind of shifts have you made?

1083
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,220
I think it's definitely just like socialized way less now.

1084
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,340
So that in itself has been a huge shift.

1085
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,980
Like I spent a lot more time with myself.

1086
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,580
I spent a lot more time with close family

1087
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,480
and my husband and my dog.

1088
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,780
And so I think that, I think also learning for me,

1089
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,540
like there's different like circles and tears of friends.

1090
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,700
I think before like everyone was my best friend.

1091
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,540
Yes.

1092
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,860
And now I'm learning that this is like my closer circle.

1093
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,220
These are like more acquaintances

1094
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,260
and kind of like shifting how I communicate

1095
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:33,260
because I feel like I was setting myself up for failure

1096
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,700
in the sense like if I treat everyone like a best friend,

1097
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,220
then they expect me to show up for things

1098
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,060
and do those things.

1099
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,740
And so when I can't do them, then they feel disappointed.

1100
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,860
So kind of just having a little bit more of a

1101
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,900
like an acquaintance relationship with some people.

1102
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,340
Yeah.

1103
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:54,180
So I don't like over promise and over commit to things.

1104
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,900
I think that's such a wise way to say that.

1105
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,780
Like it's kind of the great resettling

1106
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,540
that happens when you get diagnosed.

1107
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,100
And however painful it is at first,

1108
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,900
it allows them for us to have,

1109
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,380
I think deeper, more meaningful relationships

1110
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,700
with like our close, close circle

1111
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,380
and makes it a bit easier when you're deciding

1112
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,620
on which activities you do and don't wanna go to

1113
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,460
or can and can't.

1114
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,380
Totally.

1115
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,540
I definitely, my natural inclination though

1116
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,140
is like if I'm having a great conversation with someone,

1117
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,180
I'm like, oh, we should hang out, like let's go do this.

1118
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,580
And I just get excited and I get carried away.

1119
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,220
And I have to now like stop myself

1120
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,180
from like throwing that out there.

1121
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,020
Rain yourself in this.

1122
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,020
If I can't like follow through with it.

1123
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,860
Do you, have you pivoted to like more virtual hangs?

1124
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:42,860
Like FaceTiming more, calling more versus in-person hangouts?

1125
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,900
Yeah, I think it's been nice.

1126
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,540
Like a few times friends have organized

1127
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,740
like a friend hangout on FaceTime.

1128
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,940
Oh, that's cute.

1129
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,380
Or zoom and I feel like that's,

1130
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,300
that makes me feel good because I can just, you know,

1131
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,980
it feels like I'm going out to dinner with them,

1132
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,540
but I'm on my couch and I don't have to exert

1133
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,700
as much energy.

1134
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,260
That is, I love that.

1135
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,100
And I totally agree.

1136
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,180
Like the virtual hangouts are awesome.

1137
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,380
When I was going through cytoksin,

1138
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,580
it was during COVID,

1139
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,900
like during the isolation period of COVID.

1140
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,980
And so like nobody was really hanging out.

1141
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,180
And so I think people were more willing

1142
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,340
to do virtual things.

1143
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,180
And Cooper and I would do like themed zooms with our family.

1144
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,940
So we did like when Bridgerton first came out,

1145
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:27,020
we did like old English tea party on zoom.

1146
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,260
And it was so cute, so fun, so cute.

1147
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,580
Something to look forward to that was like dressing up

1148
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,300
and doing something, but time bounded

1149
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,780
and not the burden of hosting people.

1150
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,220
And that was really, really fun.

1151
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,580
So I love that pro tip for anybody that's like,

1152
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,100
I miss hanging out, but I just don't,

1153
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,940
I can't handle or can't physically do

1154
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,940
the hangout right now.

1155
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,940
Yeah, I think that's good.

1156
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,780
That's a great tip.

1157
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,580
I think another thing I was thinking is like,

1158
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:56,180
when you get sick, like a lot of people will reach out

1159
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,460
and they'll text you, they'll call you,

1160
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,460
they want to be there for you.

1161
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,100
But a lot of times people say things like they'll,

1162
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,020
they'll text and be like, please know how I can help.

1163
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,140
Like what can I do?

1164
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,020
I'm here if you need anything.

1165
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,940
And like the problem I have found with that is like,

1166
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,700
it puts like the burden of coming up

1167
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,780
with something on me.

1168
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,820
And then I find myself like thinking like,

1169
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:16,980
okay, like what do I need?

1170
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,980
Like how, like, I don't want to just,

1171
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,180
I don't want to just tell everyone like,

1172
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,300
no, I don't need anything because like I do need stuff.

1173
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,300
And it just feels awkward having to ask.

1174
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,620
And it's like a very broad throwing something out.

1175
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:33,460
So like what I've liked the most is like,

1176
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:37,620
when people text and they send options,

1177
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:40,660
they're like, okay, like, do you want me to drop off food?

1178
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,580
Do you want me to make you something?

1179
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,020
Do you want me to send you like a little care package?

1180
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,100
And that is like so easy for me to respond to,

1181
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,740
just like a quick like this one, like that's what I want.

1182
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,020
And then it takes the burden off you of guessing

1183
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,700
what that person is comfortable with.

1184
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,460
Like is that someone that wants to cook for me

1185
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,820
or wants to come and clean my pantry for me?

1186
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,620
Or is that someone that just wants to like text check it?

1187
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,100
Yes, exactly.

1188
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,060
I love that.

1189
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,580
I really love that actually.

1190
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,700
How do you, like for the friends that have done that,

1191
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,420
how do you now replicate that to other friends

1192
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,860
or other people that will text you like,

1193
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,020
how can I support you?

1194
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,420
I guess like when I've gotten options,

1195
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,700
it makes it, now I have like a bank of things

1196
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,060
that I can like ask people to do.

1197
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,940
But to your point, like,

1198
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,220
I don't know what their capabilities are necessarily.

1199
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,300
So, and it's also like awkward to be like,

1200
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,820
can you send me a care package?

1201
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,300
Like that just sounds like a weird thing to ask someone.

1202
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,900
Really need a new skims row.

1203
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,460
Do you have $150 that you want to spend on me?

1204
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,020
But to that point, I also think one thing that's been,

1205
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:44,580
like it's, for me, it's not about like,

1206
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,420
and I know for you either.

1207
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,940
It's not about like the price of the gift, right?

1208
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,980
It's really the gesture.

1209
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:48,820
Hell no, the gesture.

1210
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:52,300
And like one of the nicest things that I've received

1211
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,220
are when people send handwritten notes.

1212
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,060
Yes.

1213
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:55,980
Like I love that.

1214
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,780
I've definitely gotten into the zone of like,

1215
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,860
I don't love texting.

1216
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,020
I find it very like burdensome

1217
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:05,380
and like it just takes a lot of effort for me.

1218
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:09,940
And you know, I would rather like a phone call or FaceTime

1219
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,660
and then like a handwritten note is like the nicest thing

1220
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,980
that I feel that people can do.

1221
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,700
Especially when most of our mail is just endless amounts

1222
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,260
of medical bills and still having something positive

1223
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,940
in your mailbox is awesome.

1224
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,780
Totally.

1225
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,460
Or like even like if you want to just like,

1226
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,820
I think mailing is also difficult to have had some friends

1227
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,540
write a note for me and then like take a picture

1228
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,380
and send it to me.

1229
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:34,220
That's really cute.

1230
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:37,500
And that feels like just as important honestly.

1231
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,780
I totally, I love that.

1232
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,620
Yes.

1233
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,900
We should put together like a not so sick chicks

1234
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:47,060
suggested support options that people can send around.

1235
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:47,900
Okay.

1236
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,900
We'll do that for y'all.

1237
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,740
Yeah.

1238
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,060
I love that.

1239
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:51,900
Okay.

1240
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,540
One question that I have is for the people,

1241
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,220
like when you're first getting started

1242
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:00,820
or meeting someone new that you're becoming friends with,

1243
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,700
how do you gauge like what their comfortability is

1244
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,380
with you sharing the most?

1245
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,260
Like when people say, how are you?

1246
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,940
Instead of going like, I'm good.

1247
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,100
I'm fine versus how do I gauge?

1248
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,100
Like this is a really hard time.

1249
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,020
I'm super depressed.

1250
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,300
I'm in a ton of pain without making them scared.

1251
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,500
I think I'm like really honest up front.

1252
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,140
So like if I get asked that,

1253
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,060
I'll say something around the lines of like,

1254
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,060
oh, I don't know if you know,

1255
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:28,860
but like I'm diagnosed with X, Y and Z

1256
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,860
and I'm like going through my treatments right now.

1257
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,740
And then I'll kind of gauge their response.

1258
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:37,060
If they're like, oh, I'm sorry to hear that long,

1259
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,260
awkward pause.

1260
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,700
I'm like, okay, see you next time.

1261
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,180
And my dog is great.

1262
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,020
How's your dog?

1263
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:48,580
Then I usually go into like, tell me about you.

1264
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,780
Like how are things like, how's this going on?

1265
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,100
So there's that.

1266
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,540
And then I feel like the people that respond with like,

1267
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:00,700
I have heard, I didn't know if you wanted to talk about it.

1268
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,780
And then I usually respond with,

1269
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,500
no, I would love to talk about it.

1270
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,380
And then we get into it.

1271
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,740
And so I think just being up front,

1272
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,180
I think it's just a quick, easy way to tell

1273
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,380
if people want to talk about it with you or not.

1274
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,100
And then I guess one step further than that,

1275
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:20,300
for the people that we wish could do that,

1276
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,500
how do you handle like the disappointment

1277
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,900
of them not being able to?

1278
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,060
I think for me, it's like understanding

1279
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,380
that people have different capabilities, right?

1280
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:35,420
So as much as they may care,

1281
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,580
they don't necessarily have that capability

1282
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:40,980
to show up in that way or like communicate

1283
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,660
and like be emotional.

1284
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,340
And so I think just like kind of being like, okay,

1285
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,100
like that's not something that they're able to do.

1286
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,180
I totally agree.

1287
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,660
And like just reminding ourselves that like we,

1288
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,780
we all don't know all of each other's skeletons

1289
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,620
in the closet.

1290
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:56,820
And maybe they had a family member

1291
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,500
that had like an awful, awful health time.

1292
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,820
And so it's more painful for them to show up.

1293
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,660
Yeah.

1294
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:03,820
And I think people are different.

1295
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,420
Like for every person you find

1296
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:08,020
that wants to talk about these things,

1297
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,300
there's a person who doesn't.

1298
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:14,060
So it just, you just don't know where people are coming from.

1299
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:17,900
And there's also like a fine line of finding ways

1300
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,820
to be understanding or, you know, quote unquote,

1301
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,940
like make a reason for them.

1302
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,420
And someone being a bad friend.

1303
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,260
And those are two very different things.

1304
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,020
Sometimes it's hard to kind of sort that out.

1305
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:33,140
But I think if someone just can't show up,

1306
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:33,980
that's one thing.

1307
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:37,420
If someone is being mean or making you feel shitty

1308
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,820
about not being able to be there.

1309
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,660
That's a whole different thing.

1310
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,500
That's a whole different thing.

1311
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,180
Yeah, I think, and I think it's pretty,

1312
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:48,980
it gets easier to tell which type of person

1313
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,820
you're dealing with.

1314
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:50,740
Yeah.

1315
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,540
And I think there is like a grieving process too

1316
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:57,540
of the friends that we lose or cycle out of that's normal.

1317
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:02,260
But I will say like just give yourself time and grace

1318
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,380
because that ultimately is allowing space

1319
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,780
for new people to enter your lives.

1320
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:10,460
And like I'm super grateful that I had this great resettling

1321
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,820
because the friends that I have now

1322
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,780
are just like amazing, amazing humans.

1323
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,620
And the friends I had then were like honestly

1324
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,660
more surface level.

1325
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,940
Right, totally.

1326
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,940
I think another important thing is like understanding

1327
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,140
how to balance our social needs and self care

1328
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:26,820
is getting comfortable with making and staying boundaries

1329
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,500
and keeping them.

1330
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,300
What kind of like experience have you had with that

1331
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,460
and tips do you have about navigating that

1332
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,860
when we're people weasers?

1333
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,820
Yeah, I think it takes practice, right?

1334
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,140
So I think in the beginning,

1335
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:44,140
it's highly uncomfortable to say any of this.

1336
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:49,020
It's not going to feel easy and that's because it's not.

1337
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,780
So I think give yourself grace

1338
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,100
that it's not going to feel comfortable.

1339
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:57,900
And I think the way that's been the most effective to me

1340
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,740
like if I get invited to something

1341
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,820
because I feel guilt when I cancel,

1342
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:07,340
I'll usually say upfront like I'd love to come.

1343
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,300
You know, my health is kind of like

1344
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,740
or the way I feel is kind of touch and go day to day.

1345
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:14,340
And so I'll let you know closer to then

1346
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,860
how I'm feeling, is that okay?

1347
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:16,700
I love that.

1348
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,100
Like from the get go, just being open.

1349
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,820
From the get go, just being open.

1350
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:23,100
And then I think when I'm at an event

1351
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:27,940
or if I'm going to something, I will usually send a text

1352
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,700
if I'm not feeling well, but I'm still going.

1353
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,860
I'll usually send a text before and just say,

1354
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,980
so excited to see you just FYI,

1355
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:39,900
like not like a super like high energy day today

1356
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,500
or today's like a big pain day,

1357
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,300
but I still want to come and see you.

1358
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,900
And that way it just takes a burden off

1359
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,220
of staying it in person.

1360
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,780
Because you may not find the right spot

1361
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,700
in a conversation to throw that in.

1362
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,540
Totally.

1363
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:54,020
And it's not, yeah, I don't think for me it's like

1364
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,180
I don't want to say it aloud to them,

1365
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,700
but it's more just like socially finding the spot

1366
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,780
to be like, oh, like I'm not feeling that great.

1367
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,420
Especially if there's like other people there

1368
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,620
that you don't know as well.

1369
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,740
I also think like adding in, like I'm not feeling great.

1370
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,700
So I'm going to try to come for like an hour

1371
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,380
and time bound it is super helpful.

1372
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,380
Time bounding is super helpful.

1373
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,220
Totally agree.

1374
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,060
And that way you don't,

1375
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,900
that way when that whatever it is hour, hour

1376
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,300
and a half rolls around, you're like, okay guys,

1377
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,100
I'm going to head out and people already know

1378
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,660
why you're leaving.

1379
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:26,020
I get really uncomfortable when I'm leaving

1380
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,660
and people are like, oh, like where are you going?

1381
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,500
What's going on?

1382
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,780
Like what do you head it to?

1383
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,780
And you know, the answer is like my bed.

1384
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:32,860
That's where I'm going.

1385
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,140
Home, yeah.

1386
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:34,980
Yeah, that's hard.

1387
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,940
I think it's really tricky.

1388
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,860
At this point now I'm comfortable being like,

1389
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:40,700
oh, I'm going home.

1390
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,100
Like I'm not feeling super great.

1391
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,420
And then yeah, it's fine.

1392
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:45,500
But at the beginning it is super hard to do.

1393
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,460
Another thing that I think is challenging

1394
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:51,060
or that I struggled with was when I first started

1395
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:56,060
putting up boundaries, I would overindulge, over explain.

1396
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,340
You know, I'm not feeling well today

1397
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,160
because of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1398
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,340
And practicing not doing that and just saying like,

1399
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,180
I don't feel well.

1400
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,620
You don't owe anyone a deep explanation

1401
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,740
of why you don't feel good

1402
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,620
or like what symptoms are the worst today.

1403
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,380
You can just say, I'm not feeling well.

1404
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,540
And that should be enough.

1405
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,140
I think in my ideal world,

1406
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,540
I wouldn't even have to say I'm not feeling well.

1407
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,780
I would just say I'm in a head home.

1408
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,100
I think that, yeah.

1409
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,900
Like people should understand and respect and just,

1410
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,820
you know, like why do you have to say you're not,

1411
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,260
like why is that the only reason that you are allowed

1412
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,100
to go home?

1413
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:33,820
So true.

1414
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:34,660
So true.

1415
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:38,660
And I think like sometimes the analogies can be helpful

1416
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,700
without having to like go too deep.

1417
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:45,340
Like I'm having a low spoon day or my stoplight is out of red.

1418
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,740
This is a no go.

1419
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,380
Or I'm coasting into a yellow.

1420
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:50,660
We talked about spoon theory in a previous episode,

1421
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,980
but I think the spoon analogy is really helpful.

1422
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:57,260
And it's easy to explain to new people as well.

1423
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:00,140
I also really like the stoplight one.

1424
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:00,980
Yeah.

1425
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,020
I think that's what the stoplights.

1426
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:04,020
It's like green, yellow, red.

1427
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,620
So like green is like, I'm good to go.

1428
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:08,860
Yellow being, you know, caution,

1429
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:09,780
pursuit of caution.

1430
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:13,340
Like I may or may not make it throughout this whole thing.

1431
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,380
And then red is like, I have hit my limit

1432
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,580
and I can't do it anymore right now.

1433
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,620
Absolutely.

1434
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,500
That's the analogy I actually would use at work

1435
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,780
with my coworkers.

1436
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:23,620
Okay.

1437
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,660
And it was super helpful of like,

1438
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:28,260
here's how much you can expect from me in any given day.

1439
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,700
I love a good analogy.

1440
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:32,540
It makes you not have to think about the words to use.

1441
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,100
I think they make it easier

1442
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:38,140
and they make it, they make the other person more receptive

1443
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,740
instead of feeling like, oh, I did something wrong.

1444
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:41,580
Yeah.

1445
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,460
Or, you know, like making them feel uncomfortable.

1446
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:47,580
I think it just, it just makes it easier for both parties.

1447
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:48,660
Absolutely agree.

1448
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,460
Absolutely agree.

1449
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,300
Yep.

1450
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,780
What about like hosting friends?

1451
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:56,300
Cause that one is hard letting someone into your home,

1452
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,380
having them have access to like really see you potentially

1453
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:02,900
at really low points, carving out time to be like,

1454
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,140
you're going to have to entertain yourself

1455
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,420
for a little bit right now cause I got to go lay down.

1456
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,580
Like how the hell do you get comfortable doing that?

1457
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:10,580
I've like definitely fallen asleep when people are over.

1458
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,860
So I think, yeah.

1459
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,540
Like I've gotten way too comfortable

1460
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,900
with hosting at home that I'm just like,

1461
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,740
I'm in IPJs, I'm on the couch.

1462
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,580
I love that.

1463
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:22,140
If I knock out then, you know,

1464
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,620
you can either be here when I wake up

1465
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:25,260
or I'll feel a little uncomfortable

1466
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,180
but also laugh about it later.

1467
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,980
Please watch me sleep.

1468
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,660
It depends like what the combo of meds I'm on,

1469
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,620
what my treatments are.

1470
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,860
Like currently knock on wood,

1471
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:38,140
I'm like feeling decent amount of energy.

1472
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,820
And so that wouldn't be happening.

1473
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:43,660
But how I try to maintain that is like,

1474
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,700
so normally when people are coming over,

1475
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,860
I will like cook, I will have snacks out.

1476
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:49,940
I will, you know,

1477
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,780
I'll have a whole like hosting situation going on.

1478
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,220
Now I don't do that anymore.

1479
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,900
As much as I want to,

1480
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:00,900
I just tell myself like it's just not going to go well.

1481
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,140
I will have like negative spoons afterwards.

1482
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:08,060
And I tend to order in a lot more instead of cooking.

1483
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,420
Or if I do end up cooking,

1484
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,700
it's like something very simple.

1485
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,220
And it doesn't take a lot of like,

1486
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,300
it doesn't take a lot of energy

1487
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,060
as far as like me cutting things

1488
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,940
and standing up for a long period of time.

1489
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:23,940
So I think my limit is like a 30 minute cook time.

1490
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,220
And if I can't keep it under 30 minutes,

1491
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,620
then I'll order something.

1492
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:31,220
I love that's a great rule to hold yourself to.

1493
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:32,060
Yeah.

1494
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:32,900
A really great rule.

1495
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:33,740
Cause I think it is like,

1496
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:36,740
it's a exercise in self-control of like,

1497
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:39,300
I'm not going to be my normal me

1498
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,820
of cleaning everything frantically

1499
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,700
and making sure everything is making everything nice

1500
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,460
as Durinda says on Bravo.

1501
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,300
Like just accepting that.

1502
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,140
Make it nice.

1503
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,580
Make it nice.

1504
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,860
Just accepting that like this is good enough

1505
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,900
because ultimately like your friends just want to see you.

1506
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,940
Like they don't give a shit if there's shoes out

1507
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,740
or you need a vacuum or something.

1508
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,540
I know that one has been really hard for me

1509
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:04,420
because I'm very like my house has always kind of looked

1510
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:07,740
like a model house, model home, whatever they're called.

1511
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,540
And so I have learned,

1512
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,940
I have had to learn just let it be.

1513
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:13,980
I think one other thing is like,

1514
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,660
when you get more comfortable with your friends,

1515
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,300
you like really can do anything.

1516
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,620
This weekend we had one of Cooper's friends visiting

1517
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,940
and usually if it's one of Cooper's friends,

1518
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,860
I want to still like be very engaged

1519
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,540
and be a part of everything,

1520
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:30,340
but I gave myself permission to be like,

1521
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,020
I'm going to let them have time together.

1522
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,260
And I don't feel well.

1523
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,500
So I'm going to go outside and read my book for six hours

1524
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,340
and that's okay.

1525
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:38,180
Yeah.

1526
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,020
Yeah.

1527
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,300
And what they're right friends,

1528
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,900
they are okay with that.

1529
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:42,900
Yeah.

1530
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:43,820
I also feel like,

1531
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,060
do you feel like you've gotten to a point

1532
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,340
where you just don't really care?

1533
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,180
Yes.

1534
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,020
Very much so.

1535
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:48,860
Yeah.

1536
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,420
I'm like really close to getting there,

1537
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,020
which is I'm really excited for it.

1538
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:52,860
Me too.

1539
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:54,420
Because I remember when you first got sick

1540
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:55,860
and would host people, you'd be like,

1541
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,900
do you think it's okay if I leave the dinner table

1542
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:58,740
and I'd be like,

1543
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:01,700
hell yes, go to your room, prioritize you,

1544
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,740
but it's uncomfortable.

1545
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:04,540
Like same with me when I first got sick.

1546
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:07,900
It's uncomfortable to be like, bye.

1547
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:08,740
Yeah.

1548
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,660
I think the reason I feel uncomfortable

1549
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:13,300
is that I associate it with like,

1550
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,500
like when you're not sick

1551
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,060
and you're just leaving a social hangout

1552
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,500
because like you don't want to be there.

1553
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,060
It feels like that.

1554
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:21,980
Yeah.

1555
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:22,980
And this is not bad.

1556
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,500
This is like, you have a legit reason

1557
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,940
to not be there.

1558
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,500
And so to get up from a dinner table,

1559
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,420
to get up from the living room and be like,

1560
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,740
I'm going to go rest now guys.

1561
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,220
If you're not welcomed with everyone,

1562
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,620
like cheering you on basically,

1563
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,180
like got to change up that circle a little bit

1564
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:41,220
or communicate to them that I need some like excitement

1565
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:42,060
when I'm leaving the room.

1566
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:42,900
Yes.

1567
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:43,740
Gas me up fam.

1568
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:49,420
I think like one tip that's really helped me

1569
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:52,180
is when I am in those situations.

1570
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,420
And if I do start having some like negative self talk

1571
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:57,500
about feeling guilt or like this internalized ableism

1572
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,540
that I'm only leaving cause I don't want to be there.

1573
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,300
I have, I remind myself like one,

1574
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,500
the normal amount of pain is zero pain.

1575
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:08,300
No one else at this table is in stage six pain right now.

1576
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,140
Yeah.

1577
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:11,620
Two, I run through my diagnoses in my brain

1578
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:15,540
and I'm like, you have XYZ, ABC.

1579
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,540
That's enough to not, to like,

1580
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,140
to be able to prioritize yourself every single time.

1581
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:23,060
And then the last thing that I do is, okay,

1582
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:27,380
if this was be at the table and she needed to do this,

1583
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,700
I would be encouraging her to go.

1584
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:29,540
Yeah.

1585
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,380
Completely.

1586
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,140
And like have that same respect for yourself.

1587
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:33,060
Yeah.

1588
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:35,820
I also, another thing that I have found is useful

1589
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:40,760
is because I usually like overdo it.

1590
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,540
I like having time limits for myself is really good.

1591
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:47,380
So I will just put an alarm or like a timer on my phone.

1592
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:50,380
And be like one hour, one and a half hour, two hours,

1593
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:51,460
whatever it is.

1594
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,300
And when the timer goes off,

1595
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:56,220
regardless of if I'm like still like feeling good,

1596
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:59,380
it's like, I know that that tipping point is about to come.

1597
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:00,220
It's for a reason.

1598
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:01,420
So it's for a reason.

1599
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:06,420
So I will go ahead and start saying my goodbyes and head out.

1600
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,220
That's such a, I'm gonna, I'm gonna take that.

1601
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,060
That's awesome.

1602
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:10,900
Yeah.

1603
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:11,740
I really, really like that.

1604
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:13,380
Because to push yourself, yeah, like why wait until like,

1605
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,100
you're like, okay, now I'm done.

1606
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,140
Yeah. It's like the same with pain.

1607
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:18,460
Like why wait until you're in too much pain?

1608
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:20,340
Stay ahead of the spoon count.

1609
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,380
Stay ahead of the pain.

1610
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:23,700
Like we know these things.

1611
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:24,740
Yeah.

1612
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:25,580
Totally.

1613
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:26,940
And then I also like, like you and I do this,

1614
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,460
we'll text each other like, do you think it's okay?

1615
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,260
And sometimes you just need the validation to be like, yeah,

1616
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,340
you just need your friend to tell you that it's okay.

1617
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,180
And that's also all right.

1618
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,540
Exactly.

1619
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,420
I've never been met with someone saying,

1620
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,460
no, I think you should stay there longer.

1621
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,540
Or like, no, I think someone would find that rude.

1622
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:44,260
I've always been welcomed with like,

1623
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:46,260
yes, of course, like you can head home.

1624
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,340
Like you shouldn't even think twice about it.

1625
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:49,180
Yeah.

1626
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:52,220
But sometimes it's nice hearing it from a friend.

1627
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:53,060
Yeah.

1628
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,860
Your friend who wants you to go home.

1629
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:55,700
Yeah.

1630
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,020
Find your home body friend.

1631
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,580
Okay. Maybe the last thing we talk about is like,

1632
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:05,180
how do you meet new friends and like expand your friend circle

1633
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,620
when you are sick and kind of going through this resettling?

1634
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:12,620
Yeah. I think that has actually been such a surprise.

1635
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:15,060
Like the new friends that I've made.

1636
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,380
Yes.

1637
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:21,380
I've made friends through joining like online support communities,

1638
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,660
which has been really nice.

1639
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:27,260
They're not necessarily in my area,

1640
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:30,420
but like we're friends over FaceTime or phone calls.

1641
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,460
And they're either, you know,

1642
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,660
diagnosed with a cancer themselves

1643
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:36,780
or they're supporting someone with cancer.

1644
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:40,220
And so I have found that really beneficial.

1645
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,380
Also like through my social networks,

1646
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:44,060
like friends of friends.

1647
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:44,900
Yes.

1648
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,220
That have gone through something similar,

1649
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:47,660
like getting closer to them.

1650
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:50,580
And I think friends that were in my outer circles

1651
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,780
who have family that's going through something like this,

1652
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,660
like I've gotten closer to them too.

1653
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:56,660
That totally makes sense.

1654
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,820
It's like you can share a language with them

1655
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:02,620
that you can't candidly with other people.

1656
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:04,300
And it allows you to get kind of deeper

1657
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,940
and be more authentic and honest

1658
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:09,380
about like how you're really doing, I think.

1659
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:10,300
Yeah, completely.

1660
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,140
How has it been for you?

1661
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:11,980
I think similar.

1662
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:15,820
I was surprised that once I became okay

1663
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:18,340
with saying like I am sick, I'm autoimmune.

1664
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,260
These are my diseases.

1665
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,220
I found it was easier to find people

1666
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,100
that wanted to support someone like me

1667
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,020
or wanted to share in that level.

1668
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,180
And like the, like you were saying,

1669
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:31,540
like the online support communities,

1670
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:35,060
it is mind boggling to me that 15 of my like dear,

1671
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:37,940
dear, dear friends, I've met one of them in person.

1672
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:38,900
Wow, that's crazy.

1673
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:42,140
And that's like my ladies who autoimmune friend group.

1674
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:43,460
Yeah, yeah.

1675
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:46,180
And they're the people that I would like turn to

1676
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,460
for a lot of things in life and show up

1677
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:50,700
and speak my language.

1678
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,580
So I think like giving yourself the permission

1679
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,700
to make new friends, even though that's scariest shit

1680
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:59,900
when you're an adult is like really scary.

1681
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:01,740
Yes.

1682
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:02,580
It's so worth it.

1683
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:04,300
But I feel like, I feel like with adult friendships

1684
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:06,980
you at least, you pretty much know right away

1685
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:09,340
whether it's someone that you're going to be close with.

1686
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:11,980
It isn't 20 hangouts to get there.

1687
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:12,820
No.

1688
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:15,660
And you're also not like drinking at a bar,

1689
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:16,980
not really talking about life.

1690
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,780
Yeah, like you're having deep conversations

1691
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:19,900
pretty much upfront.

1692
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:20,860
Yeah.

1693
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:21,700
I totally agree.

1694
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:22,540
That's awesome.

1695
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:24,020
Yeah.

1696
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:24,780
Wonderful.

1697
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:29,940
Well, that's kind of, it's kind of the gist with friends.

1698
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:30,780
Yeah.

1699
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:32,860
It's amazing.

1700
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:33,700
It's fine.

1701
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:36,340
Hopefully you guys found that helpful.

1702
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:38,900
I think it's, I think it's just like,

1703
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,700
it's something that you pick up over time.

1704
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:44,260
You have to navigate your different friendships and.

1705
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,260
Finding like your voice,

1706
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:50,700
finding your voice on how to tell people

1707
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,380
how you need them to show up,

1708
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:54,380
how to set your boundaries.

1709
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:55,620
There's a lot of like sell.

1710
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:58,780
Like however much this is other people, it's also you.

1711
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:59,620
Yes.

1712
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,380
Maybe I would love for people to slide into our DMs

1713
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:04,740

friendship superhero stories.

1716
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:12,580
I think there's a lot of like healing that gets done

1717
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,580
when you say like, was this a bad experience?

1718
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:17,740
Like was that person a bad friend?

1719
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:19,660
And people are like, yeah.

1720
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,100
It's nice to get that validation externally.

1721
