What's your ism? I'm K. Monday at Communications Coach and I want to help you find your ism.

00:05.840 --> 00:10.000
When I was young, a catiasm was a term used by my family when I got a word wrong.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.680
Now being dyslexic, this used to make me feel really embarrassed and I used to shy away from speaking up,

00:15.680 --> 00:22.240
afraid that I'd say another catiasm. If only I knew then that actually my ism was my quirk,

00:22.240 --> 00:26.240
my uniqueness and my superpower that would later become my career.

00:26.320 --> 00:30.960
I believe life is about finding our ism, the thing that makes us unique.

00:30.960 --> 00:35.120
And now these isms are often found in the stories we shy away from,

00:35.120 --> 00:38.640
but actually are ones that we should probably lean more into.

00:38.640 --> 00:42.960
I found my ism through my challenges, my journey and my story.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.200
Now let me help you find yours.
