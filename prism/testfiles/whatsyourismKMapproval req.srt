What's your ism? I'm K. Monday at Communications Coach and I want to help you find your ism.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,000
When I was young, a catiasm was a term used by my family when I got a word wrong.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,680
Now being dyslexic, this used to make me feel really embarrassed and I used to shy away from speaking up,

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,240
afraid that I'd say another catiasm. If only I knew then that actually my ism was my quirk,

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,240
my uniqueness and my superpower that would later become my career.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,960
I believe life is about finding our ism, the thing that makes us unique.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,120
And now these isms are often found in the stories we shy away from,

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,640
but actually are ones that we should probably lean more into.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,960
I found my ism through my challenges, my journey and my story.

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,200
Now let me help you find yours.
