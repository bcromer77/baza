0	5840	What's your ism? I'm K. Monday at Communications Coach and I want to help you find your ism.
5840	10000	When I was young, a catiasm was a term used by my family when I got a word wrong.
10000	15680	Now being dyslexic, this used to make me feel really embarrassed and I used to shy away from speaking up,
15680	22240	afraid that I'd say another catiasm. If only I knew then that actually my ism was my quirk,
22240	26240	my uniqueness and my superpower that would later become my career.
26320	30960	I believe life is about finding our ism, the thing that makes us unique.
30960	35120	And now these isms are often found in the stories we shy away from,
35120	38640	but actually are ones that we should probably lean more into.
38640	42960	I found my ism through my challenges, my journey and my story.
42960	45200	Now let me help you find yours.
