Check this out, it is inhalable insulin.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:09,720
Well, it doesn't quite have insulin loaded in, but with this, you can breathe insulin.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,880
Let me tell you more.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,880
This is a fresa.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,000
It's currently only available in the US, but it is also now cleared for use in India.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,560
Currently it's only for those over the age of 18, but there is a study currently going on.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,880
It's called inhale 1, where they are studying it for ages 4 to 18.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,440
That's been going on since 2018, so hopefully they're getting closer and those younger

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,720
can start using it.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,840
What makes inhalable insulin so unique is a fresa uses human insulin.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,640
So the way it goes into your system, it acts faster and gets out of the system sooner.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,440
Unlike other insulin that are taken subcutaneously, those will take longer to peak and

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,720
will take longer to exit the system.

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:04,000
It is in powder form, you load a cartridge into the device, pop it in, and then you go.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And inhale it.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,039
The cartridges come in a few different doses of insulin.

17
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:11,680
If you want to learn more about a fresa, you can watch my podcast episode where I spoke

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,560
to a user, ginger, fiera.
