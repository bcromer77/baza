00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
Hey guys, welcome to my review of the Soulguard Carry-On Closet 2.0.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,360
In this video, I'm going to pack the suitcase, take it all around Europe, show you how

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,760
I used it, and maybe I'll give you a just-in-tech promo code.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,760
Let's go!

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:25,000
I am going to Europe, literally tomorrow, and I was in the market for a new carry-on, because

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,640
I'm going to be going on a ton of flights, and I really don't want the hassle of checking

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,640
it back.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,640
Then I saw this, this is the Soulguard Carry-On, sold on Instagram, and it really caught my eyes.

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,200
Why did it catch my eyes?

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
This is why.

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:45,440
It has this, a clothing divider, and for someone who's super OCD, this is really exciting.

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,040
If you can tell, I'm pretty OCD.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,000
Just got this in the mail, thank you Soulguard.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,600
The carry-on closet 2.0 is super sleek, light and is guaranteed to be accepted by all international

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,840
airlines.

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,560
This is why I chose it.

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:07,120
There's also the carry-on closet plus, which is 20% larger, and is accepted on almost all domestic

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,080
flights.

19
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,160
The inside is made from 100% recycled material, and each suitcase sold pulls five pounds of plastic

20
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
from the ocean.

21
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
Love that.

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:23,200
There's a TSA approved 3-digit lock, and an easy access USB port for charging on the go.

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,600
But you'll need to provide your own battery pack.

24
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,400
The suitcase has a delightful, one-pinch opening mechanism, and a somewhat addicting

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,600
plusch grip handle.

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,640
I literally couldn't stop touching it, and it's most important feature is this removable

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,280
shelving system that has six compartments and easily attaches to the handle.

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,760
It may seem like a gimmick, but wait until you see how I used it on my trip.

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,680
It definitely surprised me.

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,720
The carry-on retails for $225, just like it's main competitor, The Away, but just for you guys

31
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,520
by Awesome Subscribers, I'm giving you the promo code just intact for 15% off sold

32
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,320
arts entire website.

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,720
I threw a link to their website in the description below.

34
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,639
I'm going to Europe for 13 days, but I'm going to have washing machines at my disposal, so

35
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,880
I'm only bringing enough clothes for 7 days, and then I'm just going to wash them.

36
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,640
Let's see if I can cram these 7 outfits into this carry-on suitcase.

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,600
I threw in three pairs of shorts, six pairs of underwear, three bathing suits, six pairs

38
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,200
of socks, three tank tops, and a pair of gym clothes, and five shirts.

39
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,200
I'm going to take this thing off now, I'll scrunch that thing up, I'm going to put some shoes

40
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,000
in this compartment right here, I'm going to put my tall white socks, which are kind of like

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
my vibe.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,880
I'm going for in Europe, white socks, and white sneakers, super pumped about it, I'm going

43
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,160
to put these in the crevasses.

44
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,640
Now I can put the clothing divider in here.

45
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,440
I put my toiletries into these two bags, and I'm able to fit these right in this area.

46
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,720
So I'm going to have to put a little pressure onto this, like that, and it closed.

47
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
Thank goodness.

48
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
Otherwise I couldn't go to Europe.

49
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:11,520
So there you have it, my trip is now packed, and I'm ready to go here, I'm so excited, I can't

50
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,160
wait, check out my trip with salt guard.

51
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,240
And we were off, navigating around Europe from Airport to Airport was so much easier using

52
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:28,200
this small carry-on suitcase, and again, the grip was just so delightful to hang on to.

53
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,000
My trip was awesome, I went to the gorge of Verdong, oxymprovolts for some wine, oh, and I

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,840
met this really cool chicken.

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,680
I also saw this beautiful sunset, oh wait, right, this is a review, back to Soulguard.

56
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,800
So I've got to say I was a little skeptical when I first got the suitcase.

57
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,600
There was a high probability that the clothing divider was a gimmick, but I've got to say I was

58
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
thoroughly impressed.

59
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:04,560
So it's just a personal one, I can't wait to get out there and explore, but I had to unpack for a second

60
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,040
and we're really grown here for one day, so I was like, I'm not gonna unpack, you know what?

61
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,920
Yeah, I had because check this out, look what I was able to do, I literally unpacked and

62
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,320
all sorted, just by taking that out and hanging out, this was perfect, I'm super pumped

63
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,880
about this, yeah, let's go explore.

64
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,320
And I found myself easily throwing up the clothing divider in every hotel I went to.

65
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,240
So funny enough, I was traveling with three other friends who all had a way suit cases.

66
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,880
This was the perfect moment for me to compare and contrast the suit cases, here's what I think.

67
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,120
I'll say one downside of the Soulguard is that it was difficult to quickly and easily access

68
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,200
something from the Pax suitcase, when we landed in a new country that was warm, I wanted

69
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,400
to get a pair of shorts, but I just didn't bother, but the upside was unpacking.

70
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,440
All of my friends luggage literally looked like a bomb went off, while mine was nicely hung

71
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,240
in the corner.

72
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,640
Unlike the away which includes a removable battery pack, with the Soulguard, you'll need your

73
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,800
own battery pack, and you'll need one that activates when the device is connected through

74
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,160
its charging port.

75
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,240
Soulguard sells a couple battery packs that do this on their website, one which doubles as

76
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,320
a Bluetooth speaker.

77
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,720
One other thing I noticed was this, it looks like the clothing divider was being strained.

78
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,720
I'm not sure how long that's going to last, but Soulguard did tell me this is covered under

79
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,440
the 10-year warranty, I feel like this could have been easily avoided if the band was looped

80
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,720
through the hard plastic inside the outer material.

81
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,360
So here's what I think.

82
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,800
The carrying on closet 2.0 is the most innovative suitcase I have ever used, for someone

83
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,200
that's organized as me, it was perfect.

84
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:48,360
I was able to pack an unpack a ton of outfits, unpacked quickly, and I had my very own closet.

85
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,800
Not to mention when I'm not traveling, I haven't organized her at home, even with its minor

86
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,520
flaws I highly recommend this suitcase.

87
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,640
You should check it out with the link in the description below, and you better not forget

88
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,360
that promo code.

89
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,240
