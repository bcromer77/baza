Hey everyone, Justin Tech here, and today I'm going to show you how to take video and pictures

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,120
off of your Oculus Go Oculus doesn't really tell you how to do this, so I have to do something

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,800
and then I was like, I'm going to make a video about it. So what you have to do is you have the download of software

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,520
called Android File Transfer from the Android website. I'll put the link in the comments below.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,480
Once you have it on your Mac or your Windows, you can then connect the Oculus to your computer.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,720
What's going to happen is the program's going to pop open right when you connect it,

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,480
and it's going to say it can't access the device storage. You don't worry about that because you

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,280
have to go in the Oculus to make it work. So let me put this on. It's going to say allow

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,000
access to data. The connected device will be able to access files on this headset. Yes, allow that.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,560
Once you allow that, the program will then open back up again. It will say VR-head setup top and it's working.

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,000
So then all you have to do is go down to the folder called Oculus, open that up, and then in there,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,680
there's a video shot and a screenshots folder. So then all you have to do is drag it onto your computer

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,080
and then you need your videos and screenshots. It is that easy. So there you go.

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,280
Go ahead and take some videos and screenshots and enjoy your Oculus Go. See you later.
