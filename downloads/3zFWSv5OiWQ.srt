00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,960
Hey everyone, a few months ago I came out with a video comparing life expulps with Philips

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,420
Hue, and since then there has been a bunch of updates in my experience and in new products,

3
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,840
so I thought I would come up with a new video, kind of updating you on my thoughts on the

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,840
bulbs.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,080
By last video I showed how life expulps created way better colors, and I thought that the

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,120
Philips Hue bulbs should be called lack of Hue, because they just don't reach the same colors

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,680
as life expulps.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,080
Since then, there have been new products released, and my experience with life expulps hasn't

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:46,360
been as amazing as it was, so I needed me to explain why I'm now kind of leaning toward

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,360
Philips Hue.

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,560
Here are five reasons.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,040
First reason, connectivity issues.

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,480
Lately with my life expulps, I have been having the worst connectivity issues.

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,680
Every other day, a bulb is going offline, and sometimes it's super simple, I turn

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,800
the bulb on and off, and it connects other times, it doesn't.

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,640
When it comes down to it, life should be simple, and they should work.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,400
Number two, there is still no serious functionality for life expulps.

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,800
They promised this does late last year, and nothing.

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,640
There is Philips Hue, they've been doing it for months.

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,800
I can use my Amazon Alexa with life expulps, but if the bulbs are disconnecting, then

21
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,080
Alexa can't do shit.

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,479
Number three, this is the big one.

23
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,479
Hue is coming out with new life bulbs.

24
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,640
Again, third generation life bulbs, and it's going to make the blues in the greens richer.

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,640
This is literally addressing my number one concern with Philips Hue.

26
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,200
Number four, the Philips Hue family is growing.

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,759
On top of the new color life bulbs, you can get motion sensors, light strips, hue blue.

28
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,160
They have cheap ass white light bulbs for $15.

29
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,880
Lifex starts at 30 for those, and this leads me to my fifth and final note.

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,680
Philips Hue has light switches, and lifex does not.

31
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,280
You can buy a third party flick buttons, but that runs on blue tooth, and you have to have

32
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,880
a connected blue tooth device with that with the app running within range.

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,200
Too many components, with you, you can turn on your light bulbs like you've been doing

34
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,400
for the last 100 years with the flip of the switch.

35
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,320
My effects, just isn't keeping up with Philips, because they're backed by this multi-billion-dollar

36
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,240
company, and they continue to come out with new products, and they work, basic.

37
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,520
