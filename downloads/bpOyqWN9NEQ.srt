00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
Hey everyone and welcome back to my Magic Leap series with many of us social distancing and

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,360
working from home these days, we've found new ways to work and communicate with our friends,

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,920
families, and co-workers, aka lots of video chats.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,280
While these video chats have proven useful, they still don't provide that presence for

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,080
use to in person, right Max?

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,080
Right.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,280
Today I partnered up with Magic Leap to show you how co-presents in spatial computing,

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,160
can be an excellent alternative to these flat screen-based communications like video chat,

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,320
and provide experiences that really are the next best thing to be in person.

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,440
I think now more than ever, spatial computing shines, and I'm really excited to show you

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,320
how to be used.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,280
So here we go!

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,920
Let's start with spatial.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,720
Spatial is a great option for businesses and colleagues to build a shared workspace where you can

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,800
meet up as holograms, the app provides the ability to create persistent room so you can save

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,680
your information and return to it in future meetings.

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,560
You can even set up social rooms like the office water cooler where people can have conversations

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,840
about Tiger King and add a nice social break to their day.

19
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:19,840
Now to show you spatial in action, I'm going to meet some Magic Leap members in the series room,

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,960
and oh my god, it looks like they are there, and I am late, so let's go to the room.

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,440
Hey, Katie, have a talk, Katie.

22
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,800
Hey, thank you, hey, how's it going?

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,000
Thank you guys for coming over, my place is Taylor.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,560
Oh wow, Taylor's right, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,080
I was legitimately taken a back by how real it felt to have their holograms in my room.

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,400
Spatial is cross-platform, it could be used on your magically desktop and phone, so even if someone

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,880
lacks a headset, they can join and follow along.

28
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,120
Hey guys, am I late?

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,360
Yeah, but does Tigerly matter anymore?

30
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,680
There are lots of cool features.

31
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,040
You can upload media for your computer, if I mean?

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,640
Yep, there it is, screen share, so that's my desktop.

33
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,560
That is way too many tabs.

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,240
Place notes, photos, and videos on display, view 3D models, and even sketch on them.

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,920
This meeting only had four of us, but spatial can support up to 30 users and headsets

36
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,440
in one room at a time.

37
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,840
Taylor explained the benefits of using spatial for company meetings and presentations.

38
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,480
You can see the people are more engaged, you can watch the people are actually looking at the

39
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,560
presentation versus just like trying their video off and fiddling with something else while you're

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,840
listening to something in the background.

41
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,840
It does feel like you're in the room with me right now.

42
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,600
Having a conversation, making eye contact with me?

43
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,240
If this could be useful for you, why don't you try it out?

44
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,080
Magic Leaf has launched the Quick Start Collaboration Package with Spatial,

45
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,640
which allows you to set up four headsets with your company and try it out for 45 days.

46
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,040
I placed a link with details in the description.

47
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,400
Now, let's head over to Meetings a free native app included on the headset for a bit of a different experience.

48
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,720
Magic Leaf has repurposed avatar chat into meetings.

49
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,120
You can now invite local and remote users to join your meetings using a code.

50
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,920
In meetings, you can chat, share your affiliate web browser screens, and share and collaborate

51
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,680
on 2D and 3D content.

52
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,440
The app includes beta collaboration features in the gallery app,

53
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,440
so attendees can draw and comment on 3D.glb models.

54
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,200
You can import these images easily using the desktop companion app.

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,640
How are your weekends?

56
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,400
Well, you might see the grocery store was fun.

57
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,800
But as you do just, I played Animal Crossing on my Switch and then ate a lot of food.

58
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,480
The avatar's and meetings are much more expressive than Spatials.

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,760
These avatars have head tracking, hand tracking, and eye tracking,

60
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,560
so you can make direct eye contact with others.

61
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,640
And you can tell when they're not paying attention.

62
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,080
There's also a new dedicated outfit out where you can personalize your avatar's physique and accessories.

63
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,640
But there are still no moles.

64
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,120
Come on Magic Leaf, help me out here, get it together.

65
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,320
And lastly, with the Helio web browser, you can create your own workspace with multiple documents,

66
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,720
videos and websites open at a time.

67
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,040
You can also throw up video chats like Google Hangouts and make the screen really big.

68
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,000
It's me again, I'm still not wearing pants.

69
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,000
And you can use that Logitech keyboard I talked about in my last video to toggle between browser screen

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,040
easily. Best of all, these screens will stay where you left them each time you pick up your headsets.

71
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,760
You can easily hop back into your daily routine.

72
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,800
You can also personalize your workspace with images uploaded using the desktop companion app.

73
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,240
I went into detail on this in my last video and if you guys want to check that out,

74
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,520
I place it in the description.

75
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,800
In just the last few weeks, we've seen an instantaneous shift to remote work.

76
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,600
And evidence that some companies can work just as well if not better.

77
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,720
People are realizing they don't need to hop on a plane or physically go to their office for that meeting.

78
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,160
Although this shift wasn't voluntary, it may have changed the way we work together

79
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,520
and began a completely new era workflow.

80
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,520
Spatial computing widens that gap even further and introduces a more life-like way to collaborate

81
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,560
in a physical space without actually having to be there.

82
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm looking at your avatar next to Keyans and like no offense but Keyans' posture looks better than yours.

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,800
That's the first.

84
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,320
I think this technology becomes more well-known.

85
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,160
Companies will switch from 2D video chats to 3D holograms.

86
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,080
I hope this video has you just as excited as I am about these new ways of collaborating.

87
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,160
And if you want to continue this journey with me,

88
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,120
one of you guys click that subscribe button down there and click that bell for alerts you don't miss a video.

89
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,200
And if you enjoyed this, give it a like.

90
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,320
For more magically videos, stay tuned. We have more coming.

91
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,600
And if you want to watch my other ones, click that playlist right there.

92
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
I'm Justin and I'll take you later.

93
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Right Max?

94
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
Right!

95
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,440
But I can fart more often now.
