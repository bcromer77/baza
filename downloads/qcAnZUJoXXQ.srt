Hey everyone, just in tech here, are you finding that your computer is basically shutting down

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:09,200
when it's in sleep mode? Well, you are not alone and you are not crazy. You're probably

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,400
getting this error message and you're not sure what's wrong, whether it's an installed app or

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,080
it's a hard drive or your computer's freaking out and you're calling Apple. Anyway, this is

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,880
a flaw in the software right now. Apple is aware of it and there is a workaround. So this

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:32,040
video is gonna show you how to fix that. So here it goes. Again, this is a temporary

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,840
issue until Apple fixes it. I will let you know as soon as Apple fixes that in a pinned

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,680
comment below. So if there's a pinned comment saying it's done, then you could just update

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,080
your software. So here it is. First, you want to go to System Preferences, then go to Energy

10
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,440
Saber. Energy Saber basically dictates when your computer screen goes to sleep. So right

11
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:57,879
now I have it on about an hour and a half. You're gonna need to put that to never. It does

12
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:03,879
say never letting your display go to sleep, make sure it's light, which is true. But temporarily,

13
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:09,640
this will be just fine. And again, Apple is going to fix this eventually. This is just a temporary

14
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,160
fix. So how many times can I say a temporary in this video? Anyway, one way to balance this out

15
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,759
is to go back into your settings and then go to Desktop and Screen Saber. And then just make sure you

16
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,960
have a screen table on. I have my screen table come on every 20 minutes of inactivity. And I have

17
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,440
this fun one that's like my super favorite. It's really pretty. Okay. Really pretty. Anyway, that will

18
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:38,280
help kind of just save your lifespan of your computer screen. There you have it. That is the fix. Again,

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,880
it is temporary. But there is going to be hopefully a fix soon from Apple and I will let you know as soon

20
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,120
as that comes out. Anyway, I hope this video helped you out. And if it did, why don't you give me

21
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,000
a big old like? That way, other people can find it and solve it for themselves. I have got lots

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,560
