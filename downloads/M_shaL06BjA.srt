1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
This year's E3 was packed with announcements and attendees lining up to play games.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,000
There was also a lot of buzz because of the glaring accents of play stations.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,760
But I've got to say, this year's event was packed with a stunning variety of booths, games,

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,720
and technology, not to mention surprises out the Wazoo.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,940
I learned first hand, bass, and body about some emerging technology, played some highly

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,720
anticipated games, and has very important business meanings.

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:38,360
Even with my itinerary being as packed as it was, I still somehow managed to find time

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:50,239
to work out, dance, and time to recharge.

9
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,280
Here we are at E3 2019, one of the world's biggest gaming conventions.

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,440
I'm so excited to head in there and see all of the video games and technology.

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,320
If you guys see this graphic throughout the video, that means I'm coming out of the video,

12
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,120
specifically on that topic.

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,320
So, subscribe to this channel so you can watch it.

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,320
I'm going to go ahead on in.

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,880
Why can't you join me?

16
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,560
E3 is a gaming conference, so I'll start with some games and VR.

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,800
But I tested out lots of emerging tech, and this video will cover all of my highlights.

18
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,880
If you want to just see the booth that blew my mind, skip to red pill VR.

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,880
The first game I'm going to try is Pokemon, Sword, and Shield.

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,839
Something just doesn't feel right to me, though.

21
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:34,679
How about this?

22
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:37,600
Not that one.

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
There we go.

24
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Feeling legendary.

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Let's go.

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,320
I'm about to enter this Pokemon stadium and fight some Pokemon.

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,320
Let me practice.

28
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,320
Got it.

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,320
Got a stretch.

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,320
Yeah.

31
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Just like tennis.

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
Are you ready?

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
I'm ready.

34
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,320
Oh, okay.

35
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,320
Yes.

36
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,840
After my warm welcome, I hopped into the demo.

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,440
Which had me at a water game, solving a puzzle by turning waterfalls on and off and fighting

38
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,440
Pokemon battles.

39
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,200
I faced the gym leader Nest up and experienced Dino Max mode for the first time.

40
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,600
It's a fun mechanic, but nothing groundbreaking.

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,640
Well, maybe literally.

42
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,920
This demo has me ready to walk through some tall grass and avoid eye contact with strangers

43
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
that all costs.

44
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,320
E3 is a gaming conference.

45
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
We can know what?

46
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,960
There is a ton of technology, and I had to cover all of it.

47
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
You know what?

48
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,520
It was covering all of me.

49
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,400
First up was the Unreal Garden, where I put on the Microsoft HoloLens and walked through

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,400
an avatar-like interactive garden.

51
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,560
Look at all these people, just pointing their fingers around.

52
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,720
It looks kind of funny.

53
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,120
The garden was full of holographic art pieces floating jellyfish in a flying nanta.

54
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,880
So what exactly is going on over here?

55
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,440
We have a technology to deliver, we have to keep back using ultrasound.

56
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,320
So you can see it's basically ultrasound waves, hitting the palm of your hand and creating

57
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
sensation.

58
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,400
Oh, right now I'm experiencing ultrasound waves.

59
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,000
I can't say if that's something that I've ever experienced before.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Is it a boy?

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,680
The Unreal Garden looked beautiful, but augmented reality is still really limited by the technology.

62
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,320
On the HoloLens, you only see the world on a small screen, and the holograms blocked people

63
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,640
even if they were technically closer to you.

64
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,200
I'm anxious to see how the technologies improve, but the HoloLens 2 coming out later this

65
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
year.

66
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,840
Next up, virtual reality.

67
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,680
VR took over this year's event with booths like Facebook Gaming and Oculus and attendance,

68
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,480
and in case you didn't know, Facebook owns Oculus.

69
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,040
I played games across all different VR systems, but I was most impressed with Stormland

70
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,360
on the Rift S. Stormland transported me to a dystopian future where I was a robot tracing back

71
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
memories.

72
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,000
I found weapons and upgrades that gave me the ability to fly and climb walls.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,160
The level was beautiful, and I can't wait to play more so I can discover even more

74
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,200
worlds and fight enemies.

75
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,079
Stormland is one of the games that literally sells you on the Rift S. I don't have a Rift

76
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,600
S, but I really want one now, because that game was unbelievable.

77
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,560
Definitely check out Stormland if there's a demo around you, you have to do it.

78
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,079
The game comes out this holiday season, so definitely stay tuned for it.

79
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,600
Next, I met up with Philips Hue, my favorite smart lighting brand, to check out its personal

80
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,200
wireless lighting system, Hue's Sync.

81
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,520
Hue Sync is an app that runs on both Mac and Windows PCs, and syncs all of your Hue color

82
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,160
capable lights with the content on your computer.

83
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,520
It creates an immersive experience when you're playing games, listening to music, or watching

84
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,040
videos, and it works with any media you throw up on the screen.

85
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,400
Even me.

86
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,520
Philips Hue has also teamed up with Razor to make the PC gaming experience even more immersive

87
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,520
with Razor Chroma.

88
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,840
Unlike Hue Sync, which basically takes what's on the screen, Razor Chroma allows video game

89
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,120
developers to program lighting effects within their code.

90
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,120
I played some Mortal Kombat, and was pulled into the game.

91
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,080
I'd say this is the closest you're going to get to VR without putting a headset on.

92
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,799
It's definitely something that I'm going to look into for my household, and maybe you

93
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:04,799
should too.

94
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,799
Thank you so much.

95
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:12,840
Okay, lastly, I've got to tell you about two booths that blew my mind this year.

96
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,640
The first one was Fortnite.

97
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,400
They were dance shows, game shows, and tons of food.

98
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:37,599
I spent a good three hours at this booth, and I would have stayed longer if I could have.

99
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:42,320
But, nope, I had to edit this video, you're welcome, YouTube.

100
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,120
Finally, here is the booth that had me shook it, Red Pill VR.

101
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,480
Imagine if Coachella, the Sims, and Virtual Reality were all morphed together, and that's

102
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,480
what you get.

103
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,120
Red Pill VR allowed visitors to enter an interactive electric garden dance club in virtual reality.

104
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,880
We are essentially building the future of social music experiences.

105
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,360
We believe that music is one of the most driving things that brings people together.

106
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,160
So we invented a technology that allows for infinite scalability for an artist to be able

107
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,240
to reach a larger fan base than just the number of tickets that's torn at a door.

108
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,160
We're creating worlds and environments in which artists can perform, and connect to their fanbase.

109
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:31,000
And as we as consumers of the music can have these social sharing experiences with our friends,

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,640
from different cities all over the world, sharing this experience together.

111
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,120
It was time for me to join the party.

112
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,600
So I threw on a headset, a vibration backpack, and entered the club.

113
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,120
Inside was a real DJ playing music and a giant sized dancer.

114
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,080
Both were at the booths with me injected into the game.

115
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
Hey DJ!

116
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,160
The dancer was wearing body trackers to fully encapsulate her movements.

117
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,120
Red Pill VR has invented a technology that allows them to take a stereo signal of sound

118
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,040
and break it down to its core components, and apply the audio to reactive objects in the club.

119
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,160
So you may notice that a mushroom is beating to the base, or a flurry in the air is moving to the keyboard.

120
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,880
Isaiah says this is just the beginning.

121
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Right now it's a location-based solution.

122
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:20,880
In other words, what you see here, we will show up and create and do as an immersive event experience.

123
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
So that's our sort of phase one launch.

124
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,800
But ultimately Red Pill is a platform.

125
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,520
You as an artist can come in to our platform, build your nightclub, or your venue or your space.

126
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,039
Invite your friends to come here you play, tear a virtual ticket, or have a subscription,

127
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,440
or make it free, or make it sponsor, and show your music with the world.

128
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,039
This segment is barely scratching the surface, so stay tuned for more content on Red Pill VR in the future.

129
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,280
There's the Aurora Ballet Ruralis.

130
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,919
There's the Northern Lights!

131
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,760
How does this technology make you feel?

132
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,760
Is this the beginning of Ready Player One?

133
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,599
Tell me what you think in the comments.

134
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,880
Also, don't forget people.

135
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,880
It's important to dance and real life too.

136
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,880
So there you have it.

137
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,560
That was E3 and it was unbelievable.

138
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,159
The technology and video games that I saw this year has gotten me so excited for the future.

139
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:16,240
Remember, if you saw this, that means I'm coming out of the video on that topic.

140
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,440
So stay tuned for that.

141
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,240
How do you do that?

142
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,599
Buy subscribing to my channel right down there.

143
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,400
Do it.

144
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,799
Also, follow me on social media.

145
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:25,440
It's fun.

146
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,159
As always, I'm Justin and I'll take you later.

147
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:41,520
Oh my god.
