00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
The American Diabetes Association plays a crucial role in shaping diabetes care worldwide.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,440
It's standards of care set the gold standard for diabetes treatment and technology recommendations,

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,640
influencing insurance coverage here in the US and providing essential guidance for both physicians and patients.

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,920
These guidelines help ensure that the latest advancements in diabetes management are

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,760
Accessibles to those who need it most. Welcome to the show. I'm just and I have type 1 diabetes and on here.

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,880
I talk off things diabetes tech news and management. Now, one of the most exciting

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:45,520
Recommendations that has come out of the ADA standards of care most recently is a recommendation that all people with type 2 diabetes

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:54,400
Regardless of insulin use should have access to continuous glucose monitors. This shift could have a massive impact on diabetes care

9
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,360
Expanding access to a tool that has already transformed management for so many people of diabetes.

10
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,039
Today, I'm joined by Dr. Gracia Aleppo, a professor of medicine at Northwestern

11
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:11,520
Universities Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Molecular Medicine.

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,800
With over 23 years as an adult endocrinologist, she has dedicated her career to diabetes care,

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,280
especially in the realm of diabetes technology. In this episode, we dive into her work at the ADA,

14
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,679
how an idea moves through the organization from conception to the standards of care. The rating system

15
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:37,679
behind each new recommendation, we also get into the ADA's recent recommendation that health care providers

16
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:44,400
support patients who are considering DIY. Uncleared algorithms, like those I've talked about on this show,

17
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:51,120
whether it be trio DIY loop or Android APS. Dr. Aleppo is just as passionate about diabetes

18
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,960
technology as I am. Maybe even more, and you'll hear that through her voice. Keep in mind that

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,760
anything you hear on this show or any of my pages is not medical advice and it's for educational purposes

20
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,200
only always consult with a physician before making changes to your health care. Now for the conversation.

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,720

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,680
and Northwestern University in Chicago. I've been working as adult endocrinologists for about 23 years now

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,440
and I dedicate my career to diabetes, particular diabetes, and technology. For the last three years,

26

I've been working with the ADA professional practice committee to work on the standards of care.

27

And I was assigned to be the lead, the chair of the diabetes technology section which is chapter 7.

28
