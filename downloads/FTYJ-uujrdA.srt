Hey guys, it's Justin Tech, and welcome to my Hugo review.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Now, why did they call it a Hugo?

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,760
Because I can Hugo here, or here, or here, or here,

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,080
hey, or here, or here, or here, or here.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,680
I'm super pumped about it because they added a Bluetooth functionality to it,

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,240
which is making it probably the most versatile, smart light ever.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,760
Correct me if I'm wrong in the comments below.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
So you guys ready for me to light up your lives?

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,720
Well, before I do that, why don't you guys subscribe right down there,

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,000
click the bell for alerts.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,240
And if you can give me a like for that whole algorithm thing that really helped me out,

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,560
but don't Hugo anywhere. I've only just begun. Here it goes.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,040
This is the second Hugo coming from Phillips U, and it is packing a much bigger punch than

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,640
its predecessor. For a few reasons, first, it's battery.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,320
The original Hugo only got about three hours of battery life,

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,800
but guess what? This one's going to give you up to 18 hours of battery life.

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,640
Seriously, but some colors and brightnesses will drain your battery faster,

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,080
and there's a handy list right on the box that tells you exactly how long it will last on that setting.

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,160
The Hugo takes about two hours to charge, and of course you can leave it plugged in,

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,280
and it will never die on you. So you can also Hugo know where and use it around the home.

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,280
The other upgrade is its Bluetooth functionality. So now you can control the Hugo anywhere

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,760
using the Bluetooth app. Before you could only adjust lighting with its single button,

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,280
but now you've got the app which is easy for anyone to pick up and understand. And of course you can

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,240
use it at home, connect it to your bridge, and you can control it through your phone on that.

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,480
Phillips is moved where the plug goes in on the Hugo to a new spot. A lot of people were really unhappy

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,840
with the last position, because it was difficult to prop the Hugo up. So we're good now.

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,200
Thanks for listening Phillips. When unplugged the Hugo will only reach a certain amount of brightness,

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,400
and when plugged in, it will reach its full capacity. You can control the light manually in a couple

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,520
waves. First you can do a short single press, and it will siphon between a bunch of presets.

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,280
You can also double press and hold, and it will siphon through just colors. To conserve on battery

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,640
you can place the Hugo in standby mode, meaning you turn it off via the app or press the button for

32
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,200
two seconds. But it will only last for 12 hours. Power will be draining because it's ready to turn on

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,680
at your command. If you don't think you'll be using it for a while, I recommend putting it in

34
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,560
battery saving mode. In this state, it won't react to the app you'll need to manually turn it back on.

35
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,720
I've found some really cool ways to use this thing. You could light up a car. Why? I don't know,

36
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,920
but it's cool. You can light up your tent when going camping, light up your hotel room on a vacation,

37
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,840
or light up the fort you built in your living room. So here's what I think. I love the Hugo. It is the

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,480
perfect travel in companion, and you can take it on vacations with friends and family and surprise them

39
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,800
with a little bit of color. I'd say the downsides are definitely price. It is expensive. It's $80,

40
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,240
but the way I like to think of it is a Phillips Hue bulb is $50 and with that one. Yeah, now they have

41
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,880
Bluetooth and you can take them everywhere, but you still need a socket to put them in. With the Hugo,

42
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,480
you're paying an extra 30 bucks for a versatile light that you can place and prop in lots of cool ways,

43
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,920
and you don't need a socket to plug it into. You're not going to get it as bright when it's unplugged,

44
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,840
but this is something I'll make do with because I want that longer battery life. So what do you guys

45
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,920
think about the Hugo? Are you going to get one? Also, if you get one, how are you going to use it?

46
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,000
Tell me all those cool ideas in the comments below. I want to hear them because I probably want to

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,920
try it out myself. That's all I've got for you guys today. Make sure to subscribe right down there,

48
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,760
click the bell for alerts, and again, if you want to give me a like for that algorithm,

49
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,400
love that for you for me for you. I'm definitely going to have more Hue videos coming your way soon.

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,840
They have a bunch of outdoor lights coming out, and I have to get my hands on those, and second I do,

51
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,600
you will know about it. I'm Justin, and I'll tech you later.

52
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Thank you so much.
