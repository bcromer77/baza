00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Hello and welcome to my fourth episode of my Magic Leap series.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,680
Today I partnered up with Magic Leap to show you the office of the future using spatial computing.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:16,800
This technology has already transformed the way we see a typical office, replacing our physical tools with projections.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,000
One day we're going to look back at our old offices and desks and be like,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,760
do we really use to look at all those monitors and notes and calendars?

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,160
Oh grandma, what clutter you had. In this episode I'm going to build the ultimate

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,040
ad home office using spatial computing and show you some of the possibilities we have at our disposal.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,200
And this home office is even more appealing right now when travel for work is difficult

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,640
or when you'd rather work from home than risk office germs. Oh, when I put that there,

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,040
make sure you guys do this. Like this video if you enjoyed it and subscribe to my channel for more videos

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,800
like this and click that bell right down there for alerts. Let's head over to my new and improved office.

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:12,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hello, welcome to my spatial computing office. Before I hop on in and show you

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,960
what I'm seeing, I do want to show you this Logitech K600 keyboard that allows me to type and search

14
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,520
the web quickly and easily on the Magic Leap headset and there's a built-in track pad which allows

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,920
me to control the mouse on whatever browser I'm looking at. It will automatically switch between

16
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,680
the windows. You know what, I've been all talk, but I want to be all tech. So let's hop on it.

17
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,960
I build a home office that caters to all of my needs, whether it's photo editing,

18
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,840
planning out my Instagram feed, referencing YouTube videos, or writing a script. This home office

19
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,200
will fulfill everything I need. First off, one of the very cool things about working in Helio on

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,960
Magic Leap is having the ability of connecting to a desktop. Here I'm using Nutanix frame to log

21
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,760
into a desktop environment, and I can use the resize option to set this desktop window to any size.

22
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,080
It really helps this feel like a computer of your dreams sitting right in front of you,

23
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,800
especially in the age of giant curved screens. These are really compelling ways to uplevel your home

24
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,320
office using spatial computing. I have access to the entire Adobe Creative Suite, but for now,

25
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,120
I'll open Photoshop. In addition to this, I've got a script over here on writing. It's actually

26
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,680
this script, and then I also have music playing in the background with Spotify, and I have my drop

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,400
box open where I'm looking at pictures I want to post on Instagram. I also have a huge monitor over there

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,920
with my YouTube video playing, so I can reference it for the script I'm working on. With the next software

29
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,040
update, you'll be able to download the desktop companion app, where you can easily move files or images

30
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,880
from your laptop to your device. I uploaded some photos and I created a vision board for what I want my

31
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,680
Instagram feed to look like over the next few weeks. I can totally imagine people putting pictures

32
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,320
of their friends and family all over their desk. Look at all my friends and family I have. It's funny,

33
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,920
they all look the same. I've only concentrated on one workflow with this setup, but it's really just

34
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,480
scratching the surface. You can imagine how this setup lends itself to use in finance, being able to

35
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,160
have stock data present, have new services streaming while also being able to access a dozen or so monitors

36
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,600
laid out around you, and all with simpler tasks switching between screens. You can also imagine how

37
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,560
designers can use this to have persistent data like models and reference images present or provide

38
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,840
context around them for other designs will live in the physical world. And you can imagine how really

39
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,320
anyone at home can use it to switch between research like planning a trip, shopping, or news, and music.

40
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,960
And with the growth of co-working spaces, think of the potential for devices like this to enable

41
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,400
a broad set of functionality while also keeping the physical setup needs ultra minimal.

42
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,200
Also, do you have a co-worker that you just can't stand? I have a hack for that. Hey Justin, um, so there

43
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,280
was a yogurt in the fridge that had your name written on it, but I eat it. Also, I think in the start

44
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,880
kind of gym, the gym, the gym. Also, is reading a nasterological news article in it. Justin, it's

45
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:06,400
snacks from work. The future of the workplace is bright. So this is really just the early stages of

46
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,400
spatial computing, and what we can do already is really amazing. The home office is definitely limited

47
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,959
by the number of apps, but since there's a fully functioning browser with Helio and Magic Leaf,

48
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,000
there's plenty you can do in your home office today. There's actually a really cool app coming out soon

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,680
called Bar. It's basically a customizable search bar where you can quickly access website bookmarks.

50
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,480
When I think of the future of what apps we're going to have, I think of like a weather app where you put

51
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,000
a window on your wall, and you can see outside to what the weather is, or putting a projection of a

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,640
calculator on your desk and typing it with your fingers. There are so many possibilities, and we've

53
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,440
really just scratched the surface. But what I can tell you is that the future of the home office is

54
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,760
three dimensional, clutter free, ever evolving, and powered by spatial computing. What apps do you want

55
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,560
to see in your home office with spatial computing? Let me know in the comments below. And guess what

56
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,400
guys, more magically videos are coming your way. Stay tuned for that. How do you do that? You

58
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,960
like. I'd love that. That's all I've got for you guys today. I'm Justin, and I'll take you later.

59
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,600
Glad I put that there. Don't make sure to do that. Make sure you guys do this.
