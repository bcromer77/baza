1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Why should people care about funding for the NIH, the National Institute of Health?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,800
Pretty much everything we know about the disease and how to improve outcomes for patients

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:18,600
and families affected by type 1 has come through scientific discovery, much of which has been funded by

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,500
the National Institutes of Health and specifically one of the branches that's called the NIDDK,

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,000
which involves diabetes, kidneys, and digestive diseases.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Without that funding in partnership with the commercial world, we're not going to ever see

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,300
the things that people are hoping for, which is a cure and better treatments.

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,800
Yeah, and I just hear this family member in my head saying, well, let the rest of the world do it.

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,000
Why is the NIH specifically important in this? Why can't the rest of the world in their organizations do it?

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,000
Well, I think the reality is the many places in the world don't have the same expertise

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and don't have the network set up to do it and don't have the wherewithal or the desire or the capital,

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
that it's even a possibility.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But I would come back to say, if you live with type 1 diabetes and you want things to be better for you or your family,

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
you need to support this kind of work because it's not going to get done.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Not everything has a direct, you know, profit-driven company-driven line.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Sometimes you just have to do the science for the sake of science.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And that's, I haven't even spoken about the basic science work.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You know, all the stuff that happens in the lab before something comes to me to be able to even offer to a patient and a research study,

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
let alone a commercially available drug, almost all that work is funded by the NIH.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And if it doesn't happen, all those opportunities for improving outcomes at the end of the day are going to go away,

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and patients are going to suffer.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The problems as we have in the United States, we are blessed to be an incredible country that can do these things if we choose to do them.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's just a matter of just turning where we're going to put our resources.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You need to support this kind of work because it's not going to get done.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Our government should be investing in our health.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We should want our dollars to go towards something like that.
