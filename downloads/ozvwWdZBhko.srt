00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Hey, it's Justin Tech at CES in Vegas right now.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,480
I'm outside the Amazon booth, I'm about to head in there because they have a bunch of products

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,440
on display showing off how Alexa has basically integrated everywhere now.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,160
Let's go check it out.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:24,040
2020 will be the year that your Rumi Alexa finally starts pulling their weight.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,000
Alexa will help with cooking, cleaning, and even navigating from the passenger seat while

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,520
you run errands.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,040
And now Alexa will be sharing your bed.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,800
Let's go where the magic happens.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,840
So right here we have a bed powered by Alexa.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
What does that mean?

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,920
The Docs bed is a family owned Swedish company, 93 years old, some of the best beds in the

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,920
world.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,240
So what we've done is we actually put an Alexa unit built into the mattress itself.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,120
So it sits under the bed and uses the frame to work with the psychoacoustics of the

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,920
sound as in the room.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,480
Safety features such as glass, breakage, baby crying, CO2 warnings, it's just the beginning

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,480
what you can do.

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,320
You're now sleeping with Alexa, don't tell your partner.

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,040
Okay, now I'm hungry, let's head to the kitchen.

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,320
Hey, welcome to the kitchen.

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,440
Check out this June oven right here.

23
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,320
The June smart oven has a comprehensive touch screen.

24
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,400
This enables you to scroll through the device's various options.

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,280
This range from standard oven functions to cooking recommendations on products that you may

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,560
have purchased at Whole Foods, which is owned by you guessed it, Amazon.

27
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,560
Love that for me.

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,560
Top.

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,560
Well, I made a mess.

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,960
Let's fix that.

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,600
Right over here, we have a really cool vacuum at the iRobot Roomba.

32
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,120
This one's even cooler because what it will do is, after it's a vacuum, it will come here

33
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,000
and dock and empty itself into this compartment right here.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's full.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Just take this thing out, throw it out and put it in the new one.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There you go.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Hold on.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,600
Did I just use my last vacuum bag?

39
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Time to restock.

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,960
So what we have right here is the dash of smart shelves.

41
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,640
So what's really cool about this is that you put your products on these shelves and you scan

42
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,400
what the skew is and then the shelf knows what product it is and when it gets low, it's connected

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,640
to your Amazon account and it will order the product to restock.

44
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,400
So right here we have some printer paper and I guess low, it will order you some new printer

45
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
paper.

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Alexa is also coming to a place they've never been before, your garage.

47
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,080
Amazon just announced a partnership with General Motors to bring Alexa to your car.

48
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,560
So we have Alexa who I shouldn't say that's allowed in the car so can you tell me what you have

49
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,560
going on today?

50
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,440
This is an integration with General Motors that will be launched in the first half of 2020 and we

51
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,960
are really focused on what helps drivers the most.

52
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,200
So I'll give you a quick demo here, we're tied into the vehicle with the push to talk

53
00:02:50,200 --> 00:03:00,960
but it can be reassigned to Alexa and say Alexa find coffee shops in Las Vegas.

54
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:08,400
Alexa call the fourth one, so you're able to tap into all of your normal Alexa interactions.

55
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,560
My controller lights, I can read my oven, I can open my garage door all from using voice

56
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,680
in my car.

57
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,080
So it seems Alexa is taking over in all aspects of life and I'm okay with it.

58
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,720
