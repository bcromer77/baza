00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,240
Hey guys, Justin Tech here, and this is the ET2 Friends of Hugh Smartlighting Pendant.

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,440
Yeah, you heard that right, Friends of Hugh.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,280
That means you can connect this ring of light to your Philips Hugh set up at home and have

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:26,120
full control over the color and brightness and create the perfect on the Alps.

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,960
This light is part of an entire line of Friends of Hugh fixtures from ET2 and I was lucky

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,600
enough to get one sent to me, so thank you ET2 for sponsoring this video.

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,360
Now I'm sure many of you are a little upset because this ET2 isn't the continuation

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,880
of Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial, but I'm going to make it up for you because this

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:56,880
light is so cool, so here it goes.

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,120
The ET2 Pendant is a beautiful and sleek fixture, its white dual matte ring is made of aluminum

11
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,800
and steel and is of course integrated with a powerful Philips Hugh light strip.

12
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,200
This light is in small, when it first arrived I was taken aback by how big it was.

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:19,480
I want my god is huge, it's literally huge, it's just what it's going to look like to

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,160
hang that up and it's going to be awesome.

15
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,640
The Pendant is 28.5 inches in diameter and 4 inches tall.

16
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,080
It can dangle from as high as 124 inches, look at how long the wires are.

17
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,480
I could see this light being used in super lofty spaces like over a dining room table or even

18
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,120
ballrooms, if people even go to those anymore.

19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,080
And this light shines, it can present up to 16 million different colors and will give you up

20
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,760
to 2,800 lumens of light.

21
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,280
Installation was surprisingly easy, I recommend if you're a professional or you know what you're

22
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,800
doing, that's cool, if not higher in electrician.

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,160
This is also a two person job and I was very lucky enough to have my friend Toby to help

24
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
me out.

25
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,440
Installation only took about 40 minutes.

26
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,800
The light has a really impressive mechanic that allows you to pull through the wiring and adjust

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,720
the length by pressing and holding down on the openings.

28
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,800
So after we hung it up it was really easy to even out the wires one by one.

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,760
To connect this to your setup you'll need a Phillips U bridge, it's basically the hub that lets

30
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,040
you control all of your Phillips U lights.

31
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,079
When connecting it to your bridge, the fixture acts exactly the same as any Phillips U bulb.

32
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,920
So here's the thing, the fixture was originally called the Icarona.

33
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,080
I know that they're changing that name and I don't really know why the marketing person told

34
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
me that.

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,140
So I can't really speak to that but I do know that that's where you're going to be looking for

36
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,140
as of now.

37
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,360
I decided to call mine UFO because it looks like a freaking UFO and you know what ET probably lives

38
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
on it.

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,600
Here is the lovely UFO, it is so big and so beautiful.

40
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:04,320
Sometimes I just like going in it and you can, you know, blind yourself, whatever.

41
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,240
Then of course, with the Phillips U app I have full control over it and look at how vivid the

42
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
colors are.

43
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,440
They're really, really strong.

44
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,120
You can also sync the ET to fixture with content on your TV using the Phillips U Sync box.

45
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,320
Gaming has never felt more immersive with this ring of light reacting to every move I make in

46
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
my games.

47
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,600
You can also fully immerse yourself in TV shows and movies.

48
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,760
And of course, you can use any voice assistant to control this thing.

49
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,600
Set UFO to blue.

50
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,240
Lovely.

51
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,579
The ET2 friends of you fixture is a sleek, modern and gorgeous fixture with great attention

52
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:48,760
to detail when it comes to design and installation.

53
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,160
It seamlessly meshes into your Phillips U ecosystem and enhances the ambience of any scene.

54
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,000
This fixture looks great, whether you're using it for a nightlight, a candle lit dinner,

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,480
movies, or gaming.

56
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,960
Not to mention, it gives off an impressive amount of brightness and extremely vivid colors.

57
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,040
All this beauty doesn't come cheap.

58
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,000
The light retails for 9.78.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Why?

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,120
Because it's a well-made designer light with mechanics that make installation much easier and give

61
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,240
you the ability to alter the length at any time.

62
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,240
So there you guys have it.

63
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,240
That is the ET2 Pending fixture.

64
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,080
You're formally known as the ICorona, but we're not talking about that.

65
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,880
Anyway, I hope you guys enjoyed this video.

66
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,800
I have a lot more smart home coming your way.

67
