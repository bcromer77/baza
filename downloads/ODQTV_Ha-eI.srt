1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey guys, I am back at the void at the Santa Monica Promenade.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm here to play the Ralph Rakes VR experience.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
But you know what, this is going to be way more fun with friends.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So why don't I get some?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Guys, that was your cue.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh, sorry, doesn't it?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let me, ready to redo?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, so we're going to do that again.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We'll do it again.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But like I said, this VR experience is way better with friends.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So let's get some.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Whoa, oh my god, my friends are here.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
All right, well, let's go, let's go, let's go, try this out.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's do it.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So last time I was here, I played Star Wars and Nicodemus

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and was so impressed I had to come back.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The accuracy of the body and hand tracking

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and how completely immersed I was had me gobsmacked

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and a bit freaked out.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I was left wanting more.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And that's why I'm back to play Ralph Rakes VR

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
from the Walt Disney Company and ILM X-Lab.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I was told this game had a point system

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and was better with friends.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So I brought my VR a literate friend, Jenna

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and my most competitive friend Max.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What is your experience with VR?

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Truly next to nothing.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I have used the Oculus.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I played some beat blaster.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It was awesome.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I nearly fell a little bit later.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Beat Saber, excuse me.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We're apparently all living in a simulation already.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So my whole life.

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm truly a little afraid of VR,

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
but I'm excited for like a totally interactive gaming experience.

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm going to be so bad at it.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How competitive are you?

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm competitive.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm ready to win.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm ready to fight.

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm ready to kill with me.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Like, I have to.

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Love that.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
First we were off to the briefing room

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
so we could prepare for our jump into the internet.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Then we got to choose our own characters.

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What we would look like in the game.

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Obviously I chose the one who makes the best dad jokes.

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It was unbelievable.

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
After some quick stretching,

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
some squats and some ballet,

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
we were ready to plug in to the virtual world.

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And we were in.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The first thing that caught our eyes was each other.

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We all became our quirky cartoon characters

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and needed a moment just to deal with it.

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The game had a sneak onto the internet

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
with Reckitt Ralph and Benel B. Von Schwees.

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We went from room to room, playing a bunch of fun minigames.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
As we played, we could see the score in a risk.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The game had the same self-referential

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and met at home as Ralph breaks the internet.

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And that's what I loved about it.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The minigames were fun, quirky, and simple yet strategic.

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
At one point we were shooting pancakes and milkshakes at cats and bunnies.

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And if we weren't immersed enough, we could even smell and feel the game.

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
My favorite part was when our group was split up for a game.

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And it literally seemed like Max was taking a hundred feet away.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It was not a winner over here.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
As soon as we were finished, I was ready to hop back in and get an even better score.

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, and Max won and we were all really proud of them.

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It was our winner.

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I wasn't jealous at all.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Besides winning, what did you love?

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So, thank you so much for saying that again.

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I went in there to think that I was going to be a bear.

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I was going to be a bear.

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It was a bear.

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It was a bear.

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It was a bear.

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It was a bear.

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It was a bear.

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I wasn't jealous at all.

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Besides winning, what did you love?

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So thank you so much for saying that again.

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I went in there to think that I was going to be a very competitive person.

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm just like focusing on the games.

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But I could not do that without walking to eat from the first thing.

92
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Oh my god.

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This is f***.

94
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I've definitely went in this a bit of a skeptic.

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Thinking that VR is dim.

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's not for me.

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm like a little freaked out.

98
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But genuinely, I want to bring my friends and my family to the void.

99
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It was so cool.

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
An indescribable experience.

101
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You just have to see it gently.

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So there you have it.

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Fun for the friends of family.

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Back to your Justin.

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thank you Justin.

106
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So I've got to say at this point that Ralph Frick's VR is my favorite at the void.

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This game is the most strategic and has the most replayability.

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The experience did feel a little short at just 15 minutes.

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So I hope the void introduces longer games in the future.

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'd also love to see games that allow more than four players.

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The void is one of the best VR experiences out there.

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And you can check it out now in one of these cities.

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The void's also coming to a bunch of other cities soon.

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Are there other awesome places I need to check out?

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Tell me about them in the comments below.

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Also, let me know if you go to the void.

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What you thought about it and what your score was in Ralph Brick's VR.

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh, make sure you subscribe to this channel and click that bell button for notifications.

119
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That was Ralph Brick's VR at the void.

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
A truly awesome VR experience.

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Definitely check it out.

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You know what?

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Why do you enter my giveaway?

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Where I'm giving away two sets of four gift cards.

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So you can go with three of your friends.

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Go over to my Instagram to get the rules for that.

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
As always, subscribe, comment, and like this video.

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm Justin and I'll wreck you later.

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh, nice.
