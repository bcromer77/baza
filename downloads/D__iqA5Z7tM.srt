1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I just received my Oculus Go, and it is blowing my mind.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There are so many experiences on this device, but these are the top 5 things you have to do as soon as you start your Oculus Go.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The first thing you have to do when you put Oculus on is check out the app store.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
There are over 1,000 experiences, games, and multiplayer options.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A lot of them cost money, but there are also a ton that are free.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The app store is basically like the app store on your iPhone, but in virtual reality.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And a lot of apps that you can play online, which brings me to the second thing you have to try.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And that is multiplayer games.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
One of them that I thought was really cool is also free is poker VR.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You're literally sitting at a poker table with people from all over the country playing poker and socializing.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I could see their lips move, and I could see them looking around.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It was crazy. It was really weird too, and they played a joke on me at one point.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And I was like, this is very odd.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Another game you should check out is Death Horizon.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
In this game you team up with others online to defeat Wave zombies.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's super fun, and it's not easy.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third thing you have to try out, this is probably the coolest thing in my opinion on the Oculus right now, is your Oculus room.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So the Oculus room is basically this one bedroom apartment.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I don't think there's a bathroom where you can decorate the walls.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You can decorate all furniture, and then you can have friends over and play games.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And just hang out, listen to music, watch clips of SNL.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The fourth thing you have to try out is surfing the web in virtual reality.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It is really weird.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So basically you can go on a website browser and search the web on Oculus.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I mean it's a little gimmicky, and am I really going to use this?

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't know, I kind of did last night, but not really.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But it's still really cool when you gotta check it out.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And the fifth and final thing you have to try is the whole theater.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So basically any videos you take on the Oculus or if you import videos, you can watch them in different surroundings.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So look, I'm watching the video I took at my home theater.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm on a lazy boy right now.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How about that?

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Then I can also change it, and I could be in a huge movie theater.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Look at that.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm just looking around, and this is a huge movie theater, and I feel like I'm sitting here.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Also I can go to the moon and look guys, there's Earth.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That is where I am right now.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm on the moon.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Well that was really cool. I'm sure I have the Oculus hair.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's everything I have.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Definitely let me know in the comments below, like any experiences that you want me to try out

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
or that you think would be awesome on the device.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Like this video if you enjoyed it.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Also follow me on social media just in underscore tech.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And subscribe to my channel. I have a lot more coming, and I want you to be there for it.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Alright, well I guess I'll see you in the virtual world.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Bye.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
See you.
