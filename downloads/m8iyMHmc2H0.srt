Hey I'm on the show floor at CS 2020 and right now I'm on stage at Monster, most known

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,400
for their HDMI cables, they're jumping into the smart home race with a bunch of new smart

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,960
home lighting and it's pretty cool let's check it out.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:29,040
Monsters dig you in several different light designs and spring 2020, ranging from 3D wall-mounted

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,360
panels to water-proof LED strips to hand-dilled or white.

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,000
We have an entire array of smart Wi-Fi lighting under monster, price points ranging from $29

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,880
of to $69 so it's available for everyone to enhance their entire living space with light.

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,240
These are two flagship items, Prism and Digit and they allow you to create modular patterns

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,000
of light and color to really reinvigorate your space.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,800
The Prism light panels have a unique magnet bracketing system so mounting and moving around

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,720
your light design is easy. Digit does the same thing but you can write custom messages and draw shapes

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,000
so it allows you to write anything you want, tell the time, write your name, write fun little messages.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Could you put like, see yaaase?

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,440
See yaaase definitely, love that.

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:22,800
This one's my favorite, this is the orb. This is a handheld rechargeable indoor outdoor lighting unit.

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,920
The orbs have a built-in handle, our water resistant, and can hang as pendant lights.

17
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,720
Another thing I love about these lights, you don't need a bridge, just Wi-Fi and the monster

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,680
lights app. Can you tell me a little bit about the monster lighting app? Absolutely.

19
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,080
So our map. Absolutely. Absolutely. Our monster app gives you full control over multi color,

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:50,080
multi white, and color changing modes. So you can create custom scenes that are mixed between

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,640
the color pattern, whether it's flashing, fading, dancing to the music and how fast it's going,

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,920
what colors it's using, what brightness, what speeds, and you can save that all into a custom

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,920
built scene. There are also preset ambient moods on the monster lights app.

24
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,520
That give you everything from soft light to read by to fun swirling colors and strobe lights.

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,320
This light bar right here, what is this exactly? How does that work?

26
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,960
Cool thing about this is the stand. Right now it's set into horizontal mode,

27
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,960
but you can also use adhesive or screw and make it wall-mounted for a nice little sconce.

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,840
Or you can remove it and snap it here on the bottom to have a vertical light bar,

29
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,680
hop one in every corner, and suddenly your entire room is changing colors.

30
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,640
So monsters lighting seems to be a beast of a product and it doesn't have a scary price point.

31
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,440
Alright guys, I don't want to get a ticket. Make sure you subscribe right down there. I got more

32
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,960
