here it is it is the Oculus Quest so the Oculus Quest comes in two versions the 64GB and the

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,040
128GB I had to go with the 128GB because I didn't want to worry about space this one was

5
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:45,960
499 as opposed to the 399 for the 64GB all right so let's unbox this thing let's unbox

6
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,480

7
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,000
things is to use your fingernail just back and forth so I'm gonna go in there and I'm just gonna go

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,879
back and forth right that like that ah it actually didn't hurt I don't think oh my god

16
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:12,519
with so cool about the Oculus Quest this is the first VR headset that can take into account your

17
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:18,519
surroundings without being connected to a PC basically I'll put this on and it will be able to see my

18
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:26,360
surroundings and be able to have depth perception to now we have the trollers I really like these

19
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:36,120
wow this feels really nice look at that right hand one thank you left hand one I didn't even have to

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:43,000
read that to know it just feels right I don't love this smell of it if I'm being honest but I love the

21
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:53,320
it's got a box oh it's laid in there so nicely thank you Oculus I love this for me I love this for us

22
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:02,200
I love this for Oculus get it get it we got this for glasses this divider if you were glasses and then we've got

23
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:09,560
the charger and it is USB-C oh my goodness I'm a fan of this this is a very long charging cable the

24
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,800
Oculus go did not have a long one like this and maybe that's because they kind of want you to be able to

25
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:20,360
play still and charge I don't know if they want you doing that probably not but you can and I did it with my

26
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:28,520
Oculus go kind of got a little warm though oh we got two double A batteries I love that and some a little

27
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:36,600
pin blip and that instructions things they don't read yeah so it says before you start
