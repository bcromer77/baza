00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
AAPS is a powerful, automated insulin delivery system that runs on Android and comes from the open-source community.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It runs on the O-REV algorithm.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The system has advanced dynamic settings, including dynamic insulin sensitivity factor, dynamic carb ratio, and unannounced meal detection with microboluses or SMBs.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
These settings will adjust as it learns more about you and looks at the data that it's seen.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But what is it like starting Android AVS?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It can be intimidating.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There are a lot of settings to get down, so I wanted to explore this.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And then I'm exploring it today with someone who's been using it for about three months now.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Welcome to the show.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm Justin.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I have Type 1 Diabetes.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And on here, I talk all things Diabetes Tech, Research and News.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And today, it's all things open-source.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Now, we've talked about a system that has the same algorithm.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The app is called Trio.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's on iPhone.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This one is Android, but it uses the same system to regulate glucose levels.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's just meant for Android.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If you want to learn more about Trio, you can watch those videos that I'll put in today's show notes.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But today, we are talking to Austin Simpson, a type 1 who has been using Android APS for three months now.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
He was looking for more customization and control over his diabetes management.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
As a competitive bike racer, Austin wanted an algorithm that could adapt to his active lifestyle

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and help him achieve tighter glucose control with a goal of getting his A1C below six for the first time.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Today, he takes me through his experience from what it was like before using Android APS, what system he was using and what was missing for him,

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
what the setup was like and the learning curve for getting the settings down.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He breaks down Android APS's unique step-by-step setup progression that users must follow to unlock the system's most advanced settings.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We also get into how he uses temp targets and his Garmin smartwatch integration.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Keep in mind that anything you hear on this podcast or any of my channels is not medical advice and is for educational purposes.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Only always consult with a physician before making changes to your healthcare.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Android APS is experimental and it's not approved by the FDA or regulatory authorities.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You take full responsibility for building and using these apps and you do so at your own risk.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Austin, welcome to the show. How's it going?

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Good. I'm happy to be here. Actually, I'm really excited to be here. This is awesome.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, you followed my content in some way before this, right?

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes, whether it was like the YouTube videos or sort of the different TikTok sections talking about the new technology,

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
or I think even my favorite is all of your work to go interview people, different companies to talk more about what's being developed.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So, yeah, for at least like a couple years now.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What would you see say like interest you most about stuff I cover the technology?

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, honestly, to me, it's the like cutting edge intersection between the new technology that's coming and how it answers the problems that the users have on a daily basis.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And I really think it's kind of the position of of you to bridge the gap between us as users and then the technology experts.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And I think it's hard to connect sometimes engineers to users.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And it gives us a voice in a certain sense. So, yeah, I think it's great.

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Awesome. Did my content in any way inspire you to start Android APS or had you not heard about it before? How did you kind of get your eyes set on that?

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, so there's a little bit of a background story behind that, but really it started with my partner I had just gotten married.

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And as she was learning more and more about my life with diabetes, she started asking more and more questions that I probably hadn't asked in years because once you get down a whole with one system and get it working really well going through change and changing to something else might be difficult.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But once she started looking at your videos on loop.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We started asking, okay, well, why don't I use a DIY system instead of one of the traditional insulin pumps and then how might it benefit me.

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And then going even further after that I connected with a diabetes coach who recommended that I pursue DIY system to sort of like achieve the goals that I was after

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
that maybe I was limited by using a traditional insulin pump.

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah, and I will say I think there's a move in the community and I say DIY myself all the time, but there's a move to say more so open source because there are so many people in the community who are willing to help.

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So it's like yeah, you're doing a lot of steps yourself, but there are so many people that can help but I'm sure that you've I mean you found a coach who could help you.

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But there are so many like community boards and areas where you can can work with others to help you.

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So they're all open source and I guess I'm trying my best to not say DIY as much.

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But what were you using at the point where you were like rethinking your treatment?

55
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I guess before and right.

56
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah, so my history with insulin pumps was starting on a metronic and then from there I had gone to a T-Slim X2.

57
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So that's what I had been using at the time and I was using a Dexcom G6 and I was also using control IQ on that T-Slim.

58
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay, and why did you and your partner together feel like this, this, this which made sense for you was something missing on the tandem system and workflow you were on.

59
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah, so I think for me and this goes back to like the conversations I had with my coach.

60
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And we talked about how the T-Slim insulin pump with control IQ was limited by its degree for which it could intervene on like highs and lows for your blood sugars.

61
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So you set maximums and thresholds for how much it can raise or lower your basal insulin, but it doesn't have maybe the same responsiveness that some of these open source platforms have.

62
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So this suggestion was that by switching to an open source platform or system, you have more access to control responses to your blood sugar and you can tailor it more specifically to your life.

63
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And then in addition to that, I was getting a lot out of the T-Slim insulin pump and maybe we'll talk about it later, but I was getting pretty good percentages for time and range and the limitation was that I had to do a lot of manual work on my insulin pump all the time to accomplish those numbers and although I could get there it was a lot of like mental load.

64
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's a lot of decisions and it's a lot of like thinking ahead instead of having a system there that can kind of act as your buffer.

65
00:07:46,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah, I want to understand that more so I am currently testing out mobile and learning the ins and outs of control IQ plus which is like the updated algorithm that just released which is better than the algorithm you were using it has.

66
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You can set up to 72 hours in automated mode, which is great.

67
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm so glad that people in that community using those pumps at least in the U.S. for now have access to that.

68
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And then the extended bolts is longer as well.

69
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Can you tell me more about that decision making or constant usage of your pump system that felt like too much on tandem.

70
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah, so like the other aspect of my life that gets pulled into this is I ride and race road bikes and a little bit of mountain biking.

71
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But that's a pretty aerobically demanding sport and so managing the amount of food you take in while you're in race and then also managing your blood sugar is a lot to look at at the same time.

72
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So the way that I would I would solve not having a low blood sugar during these workouts was to think ahead of time and then because if you use the exercise mode on the T slim.

73
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It wasn't adequate enough to cover my blood sugar changes so it just didn't reduce stuff down enough and it does it to a fixed amount.

74
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So it can do us suspension, but it just doesn't respond fast enough to everything.

75
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So the easy thing for me as the user was instead of relying on the control system to do it I would just take my insulin pump off.

76
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I would disconnect it and let it sit disconnected until I manually washed my blood sugar and then plugged it back in and started using it again.

77
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So that's like one example of the limitations and it's just really its responsiveness when your blood sugar starts changing.

78
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'd be interested to know more about the control IQ plus and you know what's like the main difference between them and I wonder if they've reduced some of the limitations that they originally implemented as like a safety measure previously.

79
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But yeah, I would say that the one limit especially as it relates to your story.

80
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The new ability with temp basil which basically allows you to increase or decrease insulin treatment by a percentage from zero percent to like 250 percent.

81
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah.

82
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
While staying an automated mode that is a key feature that could have potentially helped you in that situation for me.

83
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So I started this the movie before and after control IQ plus came out.

84
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So I tried to do workouts before and it was pretty difficult for me to a point where I maybe I would have disconnected for a bit or at least turned off insulin.

85
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But now what I found I think is a sweet spot and not I have more testing to do is but what I do is an hour before my run I decrease my insulin to 30 percent which means that I'm only getting.

86
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah, only I'm only getting 30 percent of the needs that I would normally get and then I'm also putting myself an activity mode so what that's it's which is setting me in like a higher range.

87
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah.

88
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah.

89
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
This is like.

90
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Whereas on an app like what you're using AAPS trio loop all of those you would just tap on a profile or an override that does all those settings for you.

91
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So it's a little more convoluted but hey I'm glad that tandem users now have this feature there still are limitations like you can't you can't put with the ranges in fact.

92
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The activity mode doesn't show you that you're out of new range it's it's all under the hood.

93
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So there are still limitations for sure but that you know would help people out in these situations.

94
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So when I was using the tandem under the old the control IQ version so you had hit exercise mode turn it on and the only place that you would know exactly what's happening with your.

95
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:24,000
In some pump and it or the changes to your profile is the description in a handbook that's not on your insulin pump like you would have to go pull up the tandem manual to look at the percent decreases on stuff and it's not a dynamic.

96
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And percent increase based on any information it's like a fixed percentage based on your profile settings.

97
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And I think that's kind of limiting because different types of exercise dictate different different needs right if you go out and do like a sprint workout or something that's less than an hour.

98
00:12:46,000 --> 00:13:09,000
My body's going to use a lot more glycogen in my blood sugar skyrockets and now that that same if I click the same exercise button on there it doesn't work it's not it doesn't have the same effectiveness versus if I'm going to go out and do like a really long endurance style workout I'm going to burn energy constantly and I need that sort of amount of sensitivity.

99
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I think that this switching systems gave me access to something like that that's more dynamic and can change but you know I'm sure we'll talk more about like what I'm saying with the changing your insulin sensitivity over time so.

100
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah and you know these features on pumps like tandem and all FDA clear systems they're meant to be simplified because.

101
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Their safest when there are less customizations for like the.

102
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Grand scheme of customers or consumers patients who are using these systems whereas there's people like you and I people listening today that.

103
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That are very interested and want the best control and want to navigate all of these intricacies of life such as.

104
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
A spontaneous bike ride weight lifting day or.

105
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
An intense run.

106
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:19,000
This episode is sponsored by OmniPod as someone with T1D and with an incredibly active lifestyle it's important for me not to get tied up especially with tubes on my insulin pump.

107
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I love to go swimming lift weights and play kickball with friends and with OmniPod 5 I never have to worry about tubes getting in the way.

108
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Plus not having to disconnect helps me to stay in range during all of my favorite physical activities.

109
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That includes sexy time to see if you're eligible for a 30 day trial by visiting omnipod.com slash diabetic on there you'll see full safety and risk information and trial terms that's omnipod.com slash diabetic.

110
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:59,000
When you decided to go on Android APS did you go on the website like the docs website and kind of read through that entire thing.

111
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So like the first step was you have to get all of the pieces and components to it right so the first decision was like iPhone or Android of course I have an Android phone and I think phones are so particular to people that switching like devices is actually a pretty big deal.

112
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So finding a compatible system with your devices important so the phone was the first at the second step that is getting.

113
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm on OmniPod so getting those getting a prescription with those took time to switch over with my doctor and then as soon as the component pieces were sort of figured out then it was okay let's go read all of the information on Android APS so it was more of like what's available to me in the in this space and then which one has like a plethora of resources.

114
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Which one can I understand and implement and also has a lot of control features and at the same time I'm getting recommended this by my coach so for somebody who's new to it maybe starting at the Android APS docs on their website and reading about you know what is it what can it do.

115
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Is the first step but for me I was able to kind of cut through that narrow down quicker because I had a coach who was already helping me so yeah and with Android.

116
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You just you do only have that one option which is a fantastic option and is the same algorithm as trio which is on iOS.

117
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah exactly real quick OmniPod you didn't only switch your algorithm but you also switched like an entirely new form factor of pump how did it feel going.

118
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Going from a tube pump that you use a tube pump I guess for a majority of your type one to a tubeless pump.

119
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yeah that was a big that was a big change for one and a really welcome change so my so my I told you I was on a metronic pump as my first one I was on a paradigm.

120
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I started with their quick set infusion sets they had like the big insertter to that you had to carry around with you like on vacation or like in a backpack or something.

121
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So then went to the tandem ones and started using like true steel needles and those got a little bit smaller and then all of a sudden it was like okay well the OmniPod is the one that works with the system so I'm going to follow what works with the system that I want to use and prioritize the system first.

122
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But because this works as soon as I used an OmniPod for the first time I was like oh my god I forgot what it's like to not attach to it tube.

123
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And we've mentioned this previously but the craziest thing to me was the fact that like you can go to the bathroom now without having to worry about.

124
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Which yeah other people have talked about but it's I've been using this tube pump now for a month and I still can't get over the fact that like every time.

125
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I get out of the shower and I want to take I want to get my insulin going I have to like plug it in and then hold my pump before I put underwear on and where is my pocket.

126
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Yesterday I was laying in bed and I had my pump charging as it was connected to me and it was just so weird this I'm not the biggest fan of having it to but I'm still you know for science I really want to understand all this so so that's great I mean you got this new form factor that really worked out for you and again for everyone.

127
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:50,000
This is an OmniPod dash pod that you want to use with DIY systems you could also use the former pods but those require like a whole other device to connect your phone so OmniPod dash all the way you decided to go with a coach which not everyone's going to have the luxury of but.

128
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Tell me a little bit about that process once you in the coach decided okay Android APS is the way what how did you work together to get on this system.

129
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah yeah good question so really it was it starts off with like what are your goals for your diabetes and everybody's goals are going to be different right so.

130
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I mean I've been diabetic coming up on my like 20 year anniversary so so when I'm talking about what I want.

131
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm like okay I want for the first time in my life to have an A1C lower than six like that that's kind of like you made it this is awesome you did it sort of thing so that's like a big goal of mine.

132
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That requires a certain level of control so that's why we directed it towards Android APS once we decided on that then it was okay how do I work with my insurance to get.

133
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Pods how do I work with my anthropologists to inform them that I'm going to be using.

134
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
This system instead of like a traditional insulin pump.

135
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Who do I work with that has this sort of experience because they work in a community of people that can like tap you into all of these different resources.

136
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So it's it's really like navigating all of the different aspects not just like what do I set my ranges to what's my basal profile or.

137
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What was that what was that conversation like with your endo because the ADA standards actually have a new line that recommends that.

138
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Practitioners consider supporting their patients who come in wanting to use open source did your doctor was your doctor open to that or or a little combative.

139
00:20:46,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah, it was not a smooth transition at all so I had my first ethnologist that I actually decided to switch away from because they weren't aware of any of the systems they were so very like in the guidelines or the old guidelines that this wasn't something that they wanted to consider.

140
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So that that didn't go great.

141
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And then once I made the switch I again floated the idea by my endocrineologist I said hey I want to switch to this and their response instead of that's not what's recommended it was I don't know much about that let me go learn about it and so that was much more of it like back and forth like oh.

142
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Wow, there's a whole another like realm of things that I as a doctor can learn about and use to support patients so that was totally different.

143
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah, I mean the technologies moving so quickly and it's so easy for some doctors to just get stuck in their ways.

144
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But that's why conferences like ATTD which I was just at and all these other ones are so they're so important because doctors can come and learn about all these things including open source.

145
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:13,000
So I'm glad to hear that your second endo was more willing to understand and ultimately most of the decision making or.

146
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Control over these apps is is with you and the community who's helping you and your coach and your endo.

147
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Will still be able to modulate or understand the how the levels are going and make at least their small adjustments to basal bullets I think that they're still going to be able to to make some of those decisions but.

148
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Did so did your doctor when did that happen did your doctor learn about it and then come back to you and say oh like I know about this now.

149
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah, so that was towards the beginning of the year so I had my first appointment and the first question was okay.

150
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Why did you switch endocrinologists you know you've been diabetic for 19 years what's the motivation why you hear I gave that to them.

151
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:22,000
They they looked at everything that day actually and then called me about it later to confirm that they would write prescriptions for the omnipod dash pods and that was kind of like the seal of approval and then we talked about the scheme for how I'm going to report my.

152
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Blood sugar data to them because really I think that's part of the or sort of the most important part.

153
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And I think based on like my conversations with my coach the the most important thing is that your endocrinologists is doing is supporting your kind of holistic health as it relates to diabetes far and beyond just managing.

154
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You know your blood sugars in your basil like they need to order the blood tests to check for other autoimmune diseases that develop that are common across people who already have diabetes.

155
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:06,000
They need to check for retinopathy and write recommendations to go see other professionals and I think they're really kind of like the key to your care teams so.

156
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yeah, I mean they're way beyond just writing the this script so it's I guess important to have somebody who's on your side.

157
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:25,000
All right, let's get into using Android APS and we can start with set up tell me about that first week getting on how did your coach help you and.

158
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And what were you seeing I guess.

159
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah, so I don't want to take us to too far back from that, but maybe the first first that is actually building the application itself.

160
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And the step by step guide also gives you that too so it's very straightforward it's it helps you whether you're going to build this on a Mac or windows or even a Linux system.

161
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So you can actually build the app how you get it on your device how you get it functioning the importance of keeping it updated so all of that is in the Android APS docs page.

162
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:17,000
That's just a website and this page is is a dictionary for everything you need to know about the system and more over it's got links that take you to what's the behind the scenes of the algorithm.

163
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Like, how is it determined they have links to like scientific papers on the data for this type of stuff so if you want to find everything you can find all of it.

164
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But then when it comes to actually starting up the system and using it the first step that it takes you through is to run on a virtual insulin pump so you're not actually connected to anything you just have the app on your phone and it gives you you can stream your.

165
00:25:46,000 --> 00:26:01,000
CGM data to the app and it would show you what the insulin pump would have done or how it would have responded to something so it gives you the sort of initial you know I'm just going to get familiar with the screen itself.

166
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's it doesn't maybe look as refined as like an iPhone application in terms of style.

167
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
But it's got a lot of data and it's got a lot of really powerful tools in there.

168
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
How long were you using that virtual app.

169
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
That was a lot of week.

170
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Yeah, okay.

171
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah, so and this is the nice thing is I was kind of waiting on the supplies to come in and kind of get everything switched over so this is something you can prepare ahead of time.

172
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So you're kind of streamlining how long it takes to actually get up to speed.

173
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Yeah, and at that point you built the app yourself or did your coach help you with that.

174
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I built it entirely myself you're what you're essentially doing is copying a set of codes that are available on GitHub.

175
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So if anybody's familiar with like programming oftentimes people save their codes in a database and then you can export and fork that out to be used in like your own tree.

176
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So you build that you take that code and then you're you're packaging it in Android Studio, which is a app creation platform for Android phones.

177
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And then after that you can export it download it to your phone and then you have it available to you.

178
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
So it doesn't take that much work and there like I said, there's a step by step guy that takes you through every single step.

179
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And my coach even promoted to me that I go do it without having somebody sit next to me to figure out every single step because like you have to be able to troubleshoot stuff when it comes up.

180
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So there is some self education that I think is is important for everybody that wants to use something like this.

181
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Yeah, and when it comes to Android APS or the apps I've built loop and trio.

182
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:08,000
They do such a great job on all of the instructional websites for all of these to lay out the steps and they're written for the everyday person to truly understand how to do it.

183
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And right I think the first time I did it it took me two hours the second time I did it which was like year later took me one hour.

184
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Then you know a year later maybe 30 minutes you just you start it becomes muscle memory and there's I don't know with Android APS but there's like a browser build at least with the some of the other apps.

185
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It's just it's laid out pretty well.

186
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:38,000
So once you got through that first week of trialing the the fake setup.

187
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Yeah.

188
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:52,000
What was it like getting onto it specifically and were you overwhelmed by just all of the settings to this because I think that's one thing with Android APS and trio which run on the same

189
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
OREF algorithm that there are so many settings.

190
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Yeah, so I'll tell you when I first downloaded the app on my phone and opened it yes I was overwhelmed.

191
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,000
But this is where the objectives like come into play to help guide you into how to use this system itself.

192
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So there's a good explanation for every button and everything you're using and if you ever get lost you can go to the glossary in the the docs the Android APS docs.

193
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You select your duration of insulin action probably the most important setting for the predictions that the algorithm is making.

194
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And it explains what what is DIA what why is it so important and what might happen if you've said it incorrectly.

195
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And then after that you build your profile which looks more like a traditional insulin pump where you put in.

196
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Carb ratios and your basal profile your insulin sensitivity and you kind of start off really really simple and put in kind of what you know.

197
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And I mean we were talking about this earlier when you switch from one insulin pump to the next it's not the same you can't just copy and paste everything over and this is where having a coach was like.

198
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
The ultimate hack to expedite how to fix all of the little problems from trying to.

199
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
To switch everything over.

200
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I mean that's the hardest part right like the the websites for these apps don't tell you how to transition your settings to them.

201
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:39,000
They just tell you how to build it and how it works so I think that this is the most intimidating part about these so tell me more about that experience.

202
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Transitioning to the new settings how is it helpful to have a coach there.

203
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Yeah so the first.

204
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:58,000
So I I use my initial settings off of my T slim insulin pump and right away had blood sugar problems fluctuating kind of all over the place so I'm like.

205
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Looking at my phone every you know it's 20 30 minutes going okay what's going to happen now as I'm testing things out.

206
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And at the same time I'm giving this data to my coach like on a every two day basis.

207
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:25,000
She's reviewing it and then going okay now's the time that you need to do basal testing and do a fasted period to check the effect of your settings to look at sensitivity.

208
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And then we're discussing what types of food I'm eating and then looking at the response when I give a.

209
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:42,000
A bolus thinking that it should work and really you're going through basic the basic settings that you would find on any insulin pump and that's really the first step.

210
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:55,000
But she's the one who is going back through all of the data and going okay this looks good you should change this consider changing it by this percentage and that's like you can lean on the experience because they've worked with so many other people.

211
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I mean were you just carrying a ton of low snacks at all times like that you know it's scary to to be working with something new and not have your settings.
