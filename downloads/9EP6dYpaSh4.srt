00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey, VR enthusiasts, it's Justin Tech, and today I'm at the void, and you know what?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My Spidey senses are tingling, and that's because I'm about to head in there and play Avengers damage control.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's get in there and suit up.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I have my armored suit on, I'm gonna go meet up with the team.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In Avengers damage control, you're recruited by Sherry to test out her latest prototype design.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
powerful suits that combine Wakangan and stark industries technology.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
There are no physical weapons, in this game you'll use your arms and hands to shoot beams and create a shield.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I had some difficulty getting the controls down and known what to do, because I was so overwhelmed and taken aback by the fact that I was a part of the Marvel universe.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So if I had one piece of advice, try and listen.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There is plenty of new gameplay here, including flying a plane and walking down what felt like a never ending ramp.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
In the experience, you'll meet a bunch of the Avengers, and the witty dialogue from the movies absolutely shines through.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I thought, was it a glow circle right into the middle of our date?

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Scott, popcorn on the couch and reruns of Golden Girls is not a date.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
At the end of the experience, there's a score screen, so be sure to strategically shoot your enemies if you want to come out.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If you want to come out on top.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Avengers is a really cool game, but it's definitely a different experience that you're going to get from wreck it Ralph or Star Wars.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This is a very cinematic experience.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You're going to meet all the Avengers and, man, Hulk, Dr. Strange to actually kind of have a one-way chat with them.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
There were a bunch of new sensory effects that you're going to love.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And I got to say, my favorite part was when you smell something.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not going to say what you smell, but that's got to be my favorite part.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The Void VR offers the best story-driven VR I've tried.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And with each new experience, they get better and better.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If you're a fan of VR or Marvel, you need to try this game out.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It isn't going to come cheap, though.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's 40 bucks, but luckily, it's their longest experience, running at about 20 minutes.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And I always recommend playing with the maximum players for people.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I've got a lot more VR coming your way.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Stay tuned for a video on Sandbox VR coming next week.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That place had some awesome esports VR, and I can't wait to show you that.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Also, I have a huge announcement coming out on Wednesday, and you are going to be so into it.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Stay tuned for that.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So there you have it, Avengers at the Void.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You guys have to check it out.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Go to your local Void terminal and play this thing.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And if you're not around you, yet they are opening a bunch around the country.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And for my European friends, they're coming to you as well, so you'll have to check it out.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
For more VR videos and for Jemange, when that comes out, I'm definitely trying it out.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Why don't you subscribe right down there?

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And hit the bell for alerts, that way you know when the video comes out.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Also, if you guys liked this video, why don't you give me a liked right down there?

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Because that helps people find this video.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm Justin, and I'll take you later.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I will say my arms are a little tired now, so I guess you get a little workout.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Alright, I'll take it.
