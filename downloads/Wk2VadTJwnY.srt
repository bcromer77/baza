1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
Have fun at your sleep over, right?

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,240
Mommy's not looking at numbers.

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,240
It's tonight off.

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,200
It's Daniel's mom's night.

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,440
The kids are gone.

6
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm tuning out levels, except for right now.

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,480
Okay.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,920
Hi, Donna, how are you?

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,200
Yeah, he's at his friend's house.

10
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,360
She's having a sleep over.

11
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,440
It's my night off.

12
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,440
I'm doing spa day.

13
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,040
I got cute covers on my face.

14
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,800
What do you mean they don't do anything?

15
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,200
Then why are they on my face?

16
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,520
Well, they're called for you.

17
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,440
I know what we're got to purchase it all.

18
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,360
Who's low?

19
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,080
This is very nice.

20
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,680
I feel very relaxed.

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,080
Done.

22
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,360
No news is good news.

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,440
It's fine.

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,840
I'm just going to call, I'm just going to call.

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,880
Hi, Angela.

26
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,680
How are you?

27
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,680
Yeah, it's friend.

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,879
I just wanted to check in.

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,080
How are things?

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,920
They're not there yet.

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,320
Oh, they left 10 minutes ago.

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,320
Wow.

33
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,880
Since I have you here, I packed sour patch kids in the bag.

34
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,840
If you want, you can put them out in a bowl.

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,640
Just remove the yellows and greens.

36
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,280
I find the flavor is offensive.

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,280
Please, nothing over, please you 13.

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,400
And just do not show them, steal their nollias.

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,000
I made that mistake already.

40
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,240
And also not mad on web.

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,240
I'll make a lot of mistakes.
