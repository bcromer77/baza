Hey, I'm Justin Tech and today I'm going to show you how to set up Wi-Fi calling on your phone.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The great thing about Wi-Fi calling is you don't have to worry about that self-remorception,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
basically anywhere where you have Wi-Fi. It goes right through yourself and provider,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
but you're still going through Wi-Fi and you have clear phone calls. It's amazing.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So, what you do is you go to your settings from there you're going to go to phone.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And there you're going to go to Wi-Fi calling. You're going to switch that on.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Then it's going to ask you if you want to enable it and yes, you do.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And then it may ask you to update your emergency address.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And the reason it's doing this is because if you're on Wi-Fi, the emergency services,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
911, kick, track you unless you give them this address.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So, this is great. If you're at home, bad news here is if you're at work on Wi-Fi,

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
it can call and there's some craziness happening and you need to call 911.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, they're going to think and you don't get through them or talk to them.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
They're going to think you're at home. So that's the downside of this.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Upside is you're going to have really clear phone calls. It's really great.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But that's pretty much it. You're going to put in your address right there, up to your address.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And then you have Wi-Fi calling and you're going to have some really clear phone calls.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So that's all I've got for you on this.
