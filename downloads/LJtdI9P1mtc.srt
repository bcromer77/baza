Hey guys, I'm at Oculus Connect, and I'm about to go right back here and play Echo Quest VR.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yep, that's right. Echo VR is coming out on the quest, and I'm so pumped because it's one of my favorite games, one of my favorite multiplayer games. Let's go check it out.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Echo VR is basically ultimate Frisbee on steroids.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If you've read Ender's Game, it's basically that.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You're flying around in Arena in Zero Gravity, throwing a Frisbee into a goal to score points.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You use thrusters to fly around, latch onto obstacles to navigate through the field, and punch the opposing team to stun them.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
For the demo we were split into two teams of four, I was so excited to get back into the Arena on Quest.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The gameplay just as smoothly as it does on the Rift, but definitely had less graphics quality, but that's to be expected.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
As I played, I was yelling to my other teammates to pass me the Frisbee, and I was yelling at a pure excitement.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Zero Gravity in Virtual Reality is truly the best VR. If you have a Rift, get this game right now, it is free.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is the game that literally sold me on VR and VR eSports.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I really think that this is the game that will encourage some VR skeptics out there to finally get a quest.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh my goodness, let me tell you, it was unbelievable.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It was just as smooth and amazing as it is on the Rift.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It was so much fun, you'll have to check this out when it comes out. There is no release date yet, but when it comes out,

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I will definitely be making a video about it.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And if you like this video, why don't you give me a like right down there?

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It looks cute, I'm Justin, and I'll take you later.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Thanks for watching!
