00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Hey guys, it's Justin Tech, welcome back to my channel.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,760
Today I'm going to show you how to use your iPad

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,320
as a second display for your Mac.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,720
This is a super helpful tool,

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,280
especially when you're on the go.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,480
And you need the extra space to get your work done.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,600
I'm a producer and I'm constantly video editing on the go.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,600
So I've been using this lately and I absolutely love it.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,880
So here it goes.

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,520
So what I'm going to show you today is how to use your iPad

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,120
as a second display using sidecar,

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,680
which is ingrained in the new OS.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,840
I'm going to show you how to use sidecar wirelessly.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,800
And then you can also use a USB-C to Thunderbolt cable.

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,519
As well before we get started,

16
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:47,280
there are some requirements that you'll need to meet in order to do this.

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,080
So you'll need the correct Mac and an iPad that works with the iPad pencil.

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,640
So here is a list of the ones that you can use.

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,800
For this demonstration,

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,600
I'm using a MacBook Pro late 2016 model

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,360
and iPad 7th generation.

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,920
Just got it and I absolutely love it.

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,920
You'll also need your Mac OS system to be updated

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,759
to the Catalina OS.

25
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:13,560
And you'll need your iPad to be on iOS 13.

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,160
If you meet all of those requirements,

27
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,080
you are ready to go.

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,440
Here's how you do it.

29
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,320
First things first,

30
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,840
you need the same iPad account signed in on both devices

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,600
and hand-off turned on.

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,400
On your Mac, go to the Apple in the top left corner

33
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,960
and go to System Settings.

34
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,040
From there, you can sign into your iPad account.

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,000
Next, go to General and click the Allow Hand-Off

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,720
between this Mac and your iPad devices.

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,120
On your iPad, go to Settings and right up top,

38
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,160
you should be able to sign into your iPad.

39
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,160
Next, go to General, hand-off, and turn it on.

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,560
You also need to make sure Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,840
are both on in your settings for your Mac

42
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,200
and iPad.

43
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,440
Now you're all set.

44
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,480
Click that Airplay button in the top right corner of your Mac,

45
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,880
click iPad, and you should be connected.

46
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,640
While we're here, let me show you some cool features real quick.

47
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,880
I have my YouTube page up.

48
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,920
Sorry, shameless plug, but while we're here,

49
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,960
why don't you subscribe?

50
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,800
It's free.

51
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,040
Click the button right down there

52
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,400
and click the bell for alerts.

53
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,360
Also, you should totally like this video

54
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,480
if you found it helpful.

55
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,400
It helps me with the algorithm.

56
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,320
Anyway, if you click the green button

57
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,560
in the top left corner of an application,

58
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,520
you can quickly move it to your iPad

59
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,000
or set it to one side.

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You can also drag it over manually.

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,800
You can't use the iPad as a touch screen for mouse,

62
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,120
but what you can do is scroll to fingers or pinch and zoom.

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,600
You can go back and forth from second to play to normal iPad,

64
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,360
just by swiping up from the bottom.

65
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,560
When you want to go back, just hit the side car app.

66
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,200
To rearrange the iPad screen,

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,480
just click the iPad button in the top right corner

68
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,640
and click Open Display Preferences.

69
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,440
From there, go to the arrangement tab

70
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,360
and drag it to where you want it located.

71
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,240
This was all done wirelessly.

72
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,800
If you want to keep your iPad charged,

73
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,400
you can also connect it directly

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,720
with a Thunderbolt cable.

75
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,480
For my setup, I needed a USB-C cable.

76
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,520
I threw a link to it in the description below

77
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,560
if you want to buy one.

78
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,120
This connection will also be a bit more stable.

79
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,200
I've been using my iPad as a second display for a little while now

80
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,280
and I've got to say it's a really great tool,

81
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,040
but sometimes I do have some lag

82
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,640
between the two displays,

83
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,400
especially when I'm video editing on Final Cut 10.

84
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,400
So I recommend not editing in 4K.

85
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,640
I noticed that there was a lot of lag when I did that,

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,640
so I went back to 1080p and it was much better.

87
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,760
Also, I have another display.

88
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,920
If you want more space to work in, I have this.

89
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,880
So this right here is an Aces Travel Monitor.

90
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,480
This thing is really awesome.

91
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,960
It's 21 and a half inches and it's really pretty

92
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,520
that connects via USB-C to your computer.

93
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,480
And there is absolutely zero lag.

94
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,680
I'm going to put a link to this product in the comments below.

95
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,520
This is a really great alternative.

96
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,400
If you want a little more working space than your iPad gives you,

97
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,760
I've edited with this a lot on the road and I absolutely love it.

98
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,120
This goes for about $250 and it is so worth it.

99
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,280
So I hope this video was helpful for you guys.
