00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey everyone, it's Justin Tech, and today I've got something really exciting for Philips

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You people.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,960
It is the seanie conguera smart switch that is a friend of you switch, meaning this will

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,280
work with your entire Philips you set up, you can control lights, rooms, and zones with

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,280
this.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,880
Same conguera sent over a few of these to me, I set them up, and I thought they were so cool

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,080
that I had to make this video, so now let me review them for you.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,080
Let's do it.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,960
We've got the switch right there, and this comes in a few different colors, this is the black

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,200
matte black version, you can tell when there's like finger prints on it, there's also

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,560
a white one in matte and glossy and a dark gray.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,520
It's really nice build, I really like the way it looks and the way it feels, what it does

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,920
come with as well is a one switch, so it has these two switches, you can actually take these

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,480
off and then put this one switch on there.

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,040
It also comes with nice little sticky things that allow you to easily stick it onto a wall or anything

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,040
really.

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,680
Let me show you why this thing is so cool, and I'll show you that by opening up the app and finding

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,280
this one that I have already programmed, so it's right with Philips you out in settings, good

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:25,880
to access reset up, and that is where you will find my just-in-tech office switch, so if you

20
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,160
wanted to add one, you just add accessory, so right in here as you can see, you can control

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:37,119
the four different squares, what they do, so in this top, right, I have energized, which is

22
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,479
good for like in the morning when I want to be energized and get my work done, then the bottom

23
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:47,120
right is my daylight, or not my daylight, it's my bright, so it's a more warm color that's

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,580
for later in the evening, and then in the top left is this lighting, it's my just-in-tech

25
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:57,060
shoot lighting, so whenever I'm going to do a shoot, I click that button and this happens,

26
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,860
and then the bottom left, while I don't know where I'm in left, you just gotta do the trick, right,

27
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:08,020
this is set to relax, so at the end of the night, I'll click this one and that's relax.

28
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:13,780
Now on top of that, right, so I have all those different scenes on these light switches,

29
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:20,660
I can also do what a long press does, so but I have this long press to do on the top left

30
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:26,340
is I have increased brightness and then the bottom decreases brightness, so watch as I hold this

31
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:38,820
down, decreasing, hold it up, increasing, also listen to that click, it's a pretty loud click, it's

32
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,900
not like super annoying to me, it's engineered to have no battery, it's powering itself when

33
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,940
you're clicking it, it's regenerating power, and then let me show you how this works, so right here

34
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:59,380
I have the top right, do an energized, then in the bottom right is my soft right, then in the top left,

35
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:05,220
this is the just-in-tech shoot, so when I'm going to shoot a video, I just press that button and then all

36
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:11,140
of my Phillips Hue lights are ready for the shoot, and then bottom right, where bottom left is just

37
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,540
turning them all off, that light over there is just a life X light, that's why it's not going with

38
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,860
everything, don't tell Phillips. Let me go back to my shooting light,

39
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,380
and there you go, so that is how easy it is to just have scenes set on these, and instead of just rooms,

40
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,820
you could do it with zones which allow you to control multiple rooms or just lights, this thing gives you

41
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:37,540
so much capability, now if you want even more capabilities, you gotta download this app, it's called

42
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:44,900
I Connect Hue, it's 499, and you think you get all the features with that 499, and you don't,

43
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,940
they nickel and dime you for like every cool feature on here, but that's the thing, there are really

44
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,980
cool features on here for like music, and I want to do an entire episode on this app, I'm going to

45
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:00,580
definitely feature it in my Palm Springs SmartGames series, so stay tuned for that, but what related to

46
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:09,940
this, which really cool is if I go to devices, or no-not devices, if I go to lights, and that's not

47
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:26,820
correct, good automation, groups, no, I don't remember now, no settings, I absolutely forget where

48
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:37,620
this is located in the app, and I just was looking at it, why am I failing right now, okay, now I connect

49
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:48,580
you on here, if you go to settings, and you go to settings, and then you go to, no, oh my god, I just found

50
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:56,740
it, and then I lost it, got it, so on I connect you, when you go to devices on there, you've got a list,

51
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:03,380
so there's the just-and-tech office switch, now on top of all of that control, you can also on this app

52
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:10,980
control by pressing both of the lights switches bottom and the top together, right now I don't

53
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:18,980
have it assigned to anything, but that means you'll have another thing of control using the top and the bottom

54
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:27,219
together, so I will give that something at some point, I haven't yet, but that's something I'm going to do

55
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:37,460
now here's what I think, this thing is also works really well, looks really cool, I want a bunch of them,

56
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:45,380
they are expensive in the US, they're $69 for one or three for 189, which comes to about $63 each, and for

57
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:51,300
my European friends, they're available on Amazon UK for 59 pounds, I threw that in the description,

58
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,460
I highly recommend them, it was really easy to set up and super sleek design and really easy to use,

59
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:05,060
but expensive, other thing is these are coming from Germany, it's $299 for shipping to the US, and I'm sure it

60
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,820
will take slightly longer than ordering them from the US, the only other thing is there is some competition

61
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:17,220
out there, there is the run-less wire switch, which is $59, it essentially does the same thing,

62
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,580
and it's battery free, you just can't swap out the two switches for one switch, you can put it on

63
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:28,100
Amazon with the link in my description, I'm not as in love with that design, but I'm getting some

64
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,220
of those sent over for the Palm Springs Smart Home Series, I will tell you more about them in that,

65
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:38,580
so that's everything I have on the scenic and gear light switch, it'll be guys found this interesting

66
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,140
and helpful, if you want to see more smart home videos or you want to see my smart home series,

67
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:48,260
which is going to be freaking amazing, stay tuned for a trailer on that soon, make sure you

69
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:58,020

70
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:07,780
and I'll take it later, left, and then that's very, that's off,

71
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:16,180
oh, I have it said, off, which is smart.
