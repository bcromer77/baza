00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I just got some new Diabetes Tech that I've never used before.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's open this thing up.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It is a tandem mobile.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Look at that.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It doesn't have a screen on it.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It is all controlled from the phone.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And I'm trying it out for 90 days.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Very exciting.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I've got a package of 10 adhesive sleeves.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So what you can do with the mobile is you can adhere it to your skin

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
with the infusion set kind of coming out with these little sleeves.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You actually have to pay for these separately.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Five of these big boxes of two milliliter cartridges.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So this little cartridge goes into the pump and holds up to 200 units of insulin.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You've got five boxes of auto soft, XC infusion sets.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Here's what they look like.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The cool thing about wearing a tube pump will be the ability for me to un-latch

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
from this infusion set.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That's on me.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If I'm going to shower, we're going to swim.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I've never had a tube before.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It will be very interesting.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I love the tubeless life.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's open up the little mobile and check that out.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Wow.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Look at that.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There it is.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This thing is super, super small.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
There is the charger.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The wireless cheat charger.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So you put the pump onto there.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm excited for this 90 day journey.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Be sure to comment with any questions.

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
