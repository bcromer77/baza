Hey guys, Justin Tech here, and today I've got a bunch of gadgets that are going to help you

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,960
upgrade your at home shooting setup, whether you're a TikTok star, you need to hold that

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,200
camera easily, light yourself, or get some good audio, or maybe you're an actor being asked

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,400
to film yourself, this stuff is going to upgrade your audio, lighting, and shooting. Here it is.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:34,960
Hello everyone, I've got a nice tripod that you can mount your phone on from my friends at

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,040
Movo Photo. Get some good audio with this boom mic, and it's got a leveler that way you know

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,480
your shot is always leveled. You can also pick up this tripod and do some solo action,

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,920
or even just walk around and shoot other things. And for your TikTok stars, you can set it down like this

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,520
or pick it up. Now what's really great about this as well is it comes with this extension.

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,000
So when you're stationary for zoom calls or interviews, you can set it to an ideal height.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,440
This entire setup you're seeing right here is $100 and of course it comes with a connector that's

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:15,440
going to allow you to connect the microphone to your phone, both Android and iPhone. I'm going to test

13
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,200
out this mic so let's switch over to that. And this is the microphone. Hey, boom mic, how are you? So

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,840
this is the Movo Photo, boom mic, and I think it sounds pretty good. You tell me in the comments.

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,440
If you want to add in some more lighting, they have an LED light that has three different

16
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:40,000
settings and this is a shoe bracket. This will allow you to put both the microphone and the LED light right

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,360
on top. Oh, and I almost forgot it comes with a cute little carrying case so you can take it nowhere.

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,160
Movo Photo also sells a bunch of other setups. This is just my favorite. They have a bunch of setups

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,560
for holding on your hand. Some other lighting and some other mics. I will have links to all

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:02,160
this in the description. Oh my god Chelsea, you're so funny. Who's Chelsea? There is no Chelsea.

21
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,120
Also, can we just talk about how cute their labeling is. Look at this. Look at this. If you're happy

22
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:15,280
you read this side and if you're sad, you read this side. All of this has a two year warranty. Next up is

23
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,360
the moment lens. The moment lens is lens that you can attach to your phone using their

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,360
moment phone case. This right here is the 18 millimeter wide lens and what I love about this is it

25
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,800
allows me to create a much wider shot from my phone through video or photos. I could see real

26
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,120
tours dancers or just any creatives getting some great wide photos and videos with this. And they

27
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,760
also sell a bunch of different lens. This is my favorite though. The starter kit is $115.

28
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,120
Ta-da. Next up, if you're looking for a little bit of a nicer camera, I highly recommend the

29
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,800
Osmo Pocket. It has a three axis stabilizer. So when you're shooting with this thing and you're doing

30
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,600
cool moves, this thing is going to slowly move and keep it stable. We're actually using a stabilizer

31
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,239
on this camera right here. We've grown in SC which is basically a much bigger version of this

32
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,240
right there. So you see as that camera moves, that's kind of what's happening with this camera. It also

33
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,480
connects to your phone with an adapter. It's going to work with iPhones and also Android. It'll connect

34
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,480
right like that. The cheapest I found in the Osmo Pocket right now is 330 on Amazon and that length

35
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,240
is in the description. Cool thing about this thing. If you tap the button three times.

36
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:41,520
Do a selfie. Hi, come see my home. No, that's a different video. Oh, and it's also got facial

37
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,880
tracking and a bunch of other user friendly abilities. And if you want to get a stabilizer but you just

38
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:53,520
don't want to pay that much, they do sell one for your phones called the DJI Osmo Mobile 3. So basically

39
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,480
creates that stabilizer for your phone and that goes for $89. Next, I want to show you guys the

40
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,520
LED lights that I'm using to light up my set. They're pretty inexpensive and they're pretty cool. So here

41
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:12,480
they are. These are the newer LED lights spelled with two ease. And what's great about these is they do

42
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,000
take batteries but they're also plug in and then you can control the light you want. So if you want very

43
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,920
white light or if you want yellow light, you can control that and dim and brighten them. These are four

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,960
two of them. You get the stand and the light for 179. Well guys, I hope that this video made you

45
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,960
happy and it didn't make you sad. Anyway, I hope you guys found this video helpful for more tech tips and
