00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,380
Hey VR enthusiasts, I am back at the Void for a private press event.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,380
That's right.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,900
Justin Tech is here to check out Jumonji Reverse The Curse.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,060
I'm also interviewing the co-founder and chief creative officer Curtis Eggman.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,300
I think it's time to go.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,300
Let's do it.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:29,540
Out of all the movies you could have chosen, why did Jumonji fit so well on the Void?

8
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,740
I know it's funny.

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,019
A lot of people describe our Void experiences as stepping into a game, which is not necessarily

10
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:40,380
our goal, which is trying to create experiences for people to have, but in this particular

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,660
case, if it is a game, you're dropping into a game, and what more could you ask for out of

12
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,660
an IP for the Void?

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,900
In this game, you and up to three friends are dropped into the world of Jumonji, where

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,700
the evil Hakaar has stolen the sector of Sephayu.

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,460
This experience builds upon all of the past Void experiences and takes them 10 steps further,

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,580
adding new elements and features that immerse you deeper than ever.

17
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,620
There's so much that's different about this experience than what we've done before.

18
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,420
You actually walk further than you do in any other experience.

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,900
Everyone has their own special skill that comes into play so you realize the attention

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,700
of what your character is good at.

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,260
Some people will see things, other characters can't see, and some will hear things, other characters

22
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,260
can't hear.

23
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,060
You know, you've never known to lose a life before, in an experience.

24
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,380
But again, since this is a game, as Jumonji is, there's peril.

25
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,020
I mean, you can lose a life, which creates for some really interesting moments as well.

26
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,460
It was time for me and my friends to hop in the game.

27
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,580
We got to choose from four player cards.

28
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,620
I chose the monkey and was super happy with my decision.

29
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,340
My character could talk to animals and had a weakness for cake.

30
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,540
It's like his character in the movie, trust me, don't touch the cake.

31
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,580
It's time to roll those dice.

32
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,620
Every stage of the game is full of dangerous traps and obstacles.

33
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,820
My friend Max died five times in it was hilarious.

34
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,660
The part where I died came out of surprise, so be careful and tread lightly.

35
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,220
What I love so much is that our characters each had their own abilities, and that just makes

36
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,580
me want to hop right back in there and be another character, and then another character.

37
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:09,740
The amount of choice also that we'd have throughout this game to choose either A or B, that

38
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,700
was also a really great addition to this, and something that I look forward to seeing

39
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,820
and other void experiences.

40
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,900
Can we expect more partnerships like this in the future?

41
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,900
Absolutely.

42
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,740
We love working with Sony, we've been working with Sony since we did Ghostbusters back in 2016.

43
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,540
There's a lot of fun on its name, building this with them.

44
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,540
I think we can expect to see more of that relationship in the future that we love working with

45
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,540
Sony.

46
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,620
So this experience really takes the cake, but wait, don't take the cake, take the sector, otherwise

47
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,540
you will die a horrible death.

48
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:44,500
The jumanji is my favorite experience at the void so far, but the other ones are also

49
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
really awesome.

50
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,780
So definitely, if you want to check out those experiences, why don't you watch that video right

51
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,100
up there, because I've got some other videos on those.

52
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,340

Let me know in the comments below, because I want to visit it.

56
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,780
Next thing, I am doing a giveaway.

57
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,780
Head over to my Instagram for that.

58
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,220
I'm giving away two gift cards, each good for four guests.

59
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,220
Gotta do that.

60
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,220
Gotta be here.

61
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,220
You gotta check it out.

62
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,220
Okay?

63
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,220
Jumanji.

64
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,220
It's great.

65
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,220
Love it.

66
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,220
All right.

67
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,220
I'm Justin.

68
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,220
I'll take you later.

69
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:35,220
That didn't mind, but that.
