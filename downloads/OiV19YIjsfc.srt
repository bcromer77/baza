00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Hey guys, it's Justin and I am at the B-VOID.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,280
It's this amazing virtual reality experience that just opened four months ago.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,440
Let's go check it out.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,480
What sets the void different from all the other experiences?

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,320
Justin, what our goal is is to replicate what you are feeling right now in normal reality.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,320
But just transport you into this just crazy world that you can never possibly visit.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,640
Completely untethered.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,200
We call it hyper-reality, right?

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,840
Because we think it's so much more than virtual reality alone.

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,360
So we have a lot of extra sensory effects.

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,160
You step out onto a balcony and you're going to feel wind in your face.

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,000
So a lot of that little extra stuff is what helps you to fully immerse in the experience.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,040
First up, which Star Wars secrets of the Empire, which the void collaborated on with

14
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,640
the Lucasfilm and ILM X-Lab.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,879
Next, it was time to suit up.

16
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,080
I put a computer on my back and a headset on my face, and that's it.

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,680
There were no hand controllers.

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,560
The void contract my hand movements all the way down to a thumbs up.

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,599
It was unbelievable.

20
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:09,680
The Star Wars experience had us going ship to ship, engaging stormtroopers and monsters, along

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,400
the way we found blasters and were attacked.

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,240
And when we got shot, we felt it.

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,960
We also went to a lava planet where we could literally feel the heat.

24
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,120
There was a moment where I was so stressed out, because stormtroopers were shooting at us and

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,440
our droid friend was being so sassy I just kept messing up.

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,240
That was nuts.

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,039
I felt like I was on that spaceship in that lava facing Darth Vader.

28
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,840
That was crazy.

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,840
I've never experienced VR like that before and I'm blown away.

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
On to the next one.

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Let's go.

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,360
The second experience was Nicodemus, Demon of Inbanishment.

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,520
In this one, you're a time traveling detective going back in time to Chicago's World

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,880
Fair, where there's a demon on the loose.

35
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,839
It's basically a horror experience where you have to solve a bunch of puzzles and stay alive,

36
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:58,880
while getting freaked out along the way.

37
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:06,800
The cool thing about this one is that there's multiple endings based on how well you perform.

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,320
Needless to say, I failed miserably.

39
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,600
But now I'm determined to go back again and survive.

40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,120
Holy crap.

41
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,320
I've been in haunted houses before, but I've never been in a virtual reality haunted house.

42
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,840
And I've got to say, that's the only way to do it.

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,800
Now for me, I'm never going in a haunted house with real people because you can't chop their heads up.

44
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,280
This one you can, I think mine was chopped off.

45
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,520
I need to get out of here.

46
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,080
I'm where the heck do I go?

47
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,720
In addition to these experiences, they also have wrecked Ralph VR, which I plan on checking out soon.

48
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,920
I can say with confidence that this is the future of entertainment.

49
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,520
Imagine one day going to a huge playing field and running around for an hour.

50
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,280
I have to say, I'm a bit speechless.

51
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,760
This was unlike any virtual reality I had ever experienced.

52
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,760
You gotta check it out.

53
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
You got it.

54
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,200
They are located in all of these cities right here.

55
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,160
It is unbelievable.

56
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,400
Come with friends, come alone, get scared, play around with Darth Vader, so many things to do here.

57
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,280
That is all I have for you guys on the void.

58
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,400

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400

60
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,960
I'm Justin and I'll take you later.
