00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
Hey guys, welcome to my review of the Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box. I'm so excited about this thing.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,800
I've been waiting for it as we all have and it is finally here and I have so much to tell you.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:20,560
This device will basically take what is playing on your TV screen and have all of your Philips Hue lights in sync with that media.

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,560
This video is going to cover a lot. I'm going to show you how it works, how to set it up. I'm going to have it play in action

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,880
and then I'm going to tell you whether or not you should get it. Also, any Philips Hue devices that I bring up in this video,

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,800
they will be in the description below. So check out that link if you want to check out these devices.

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,200
And while you're checking it out, why don't you hit that subscribe button and hit it the bell for alerts. That way

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,720
when I come out with more Philips Hue videos, you see it. All right, without further ado, let's review the Philips Hue

9
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,160
Play HDMI Sync Box. A lot of words.

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,040
The HDMI Sync Box is a sleek looking device that almost looks like a wide Apple TV.

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,840
There are four HDMI inputs on the back where you can connect devices like Apple TV, Chromecast,

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,480
a Blu-ray player, or a video game system. Once it's connected, you'll be able to watch any

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,240
content on your TV and the box will create what I like to call the surround sound of lighting. The box

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,840
will use the sound and what's on the screen to completely immerse you into the media. The Hue Sync Box

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,560
is intuitive. It knows when you're switching devices. So right now I have it on Apple TV.

16
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,520
When they turn on my Nintendo Switch, it's actually going to act as a switcher and switch over to

17
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:41,120
the Nintendo Switch. And then the lighting is going to match that. There you go.

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,440
Voila! If you have a receiver, don't fret. All you have to do is have the receivers output go into the

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:54,960
HDMI Sync input and then have the output from that go into your TV. So as long as the HDMI Sync

20
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:02,000
Box is the last thing to plug into your TV, you're good. Unfortunately you can't have the smart TV apps

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,200
from your TV go into the Sync Box and then back into the TV. You'll need to buy an external device

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:16,160
like a fire stick or an Apple TV, etc. The HDMI Sync Box supports 4K at 60Hz and HDR10. It does

23
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,800
not support HDR10+, Dolby Vision or Dolby Atmos, which I definitely hope they introduce in the future.

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,840
Phillips Hue has included a couple slots in the power cord to connect lights near the TV to save on

25
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,200
outlet space. If you couldn't tell, it came in handy for me. In order to use the Sync Box,

26
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,079
you need a bridge and some lights. You can link up to 10 color-capable Phillips Hue lights through the

27
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:42,720
app. I do have to say I have a preference for lighting, so let me show you my lighting setup.

28
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,960
Over here, I have a Phillips Hue go right there. Then I also have these Phillips Hue playbars.

29
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,840
And this is where my preference comes in. I definitely prefer to have one of these on either side

30
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,120
because I really like the stands and the light that they shine off on the TV. So I highly recommend

31
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,000
getting those. They also come with an adhesive plate. The adhesive plates really great, especially if you

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,520
have a wall mounted TV. Then on top here, I have a Phillips Hue light strip that could also be a

33
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,760
playbar if you wanted. And over here, I have just your everyday colored light bulb by Phillips Hue

34
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,360
in a canister. And I'm going to put that canister in the description below a link for that because I think

35
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,200
it's a great thing to have for any smart home lighting enthusiast like me. All right, let's talk about the

36
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,280
app. First, you will need to download the Phillips Hue Sync app. It is a separate app from the Phillips Hue

37
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,080
app. Once the app is open, you'll need to connect your Hue Sync to the bridge. Then you'll be

38
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,200
instructed to open up the normal Phillips Hue app and set up an entertainment area. This is located

39
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,840
in the setting section of the main Hue app. After that's created, you can add the lights you want to use.

40
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,360
Then you drag around the lights to where they're located in the room and assign the vertical position

41
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,400
by tapping on the light. There's ground height, TV height, and ceiling height. I really love that when

42
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,360
you're setting up a light, it turns green and flashes. This makes it super easy to know which light

43
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,760
you're setting up and it's a great touch. There's also the option to set the behavior of your

44
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,760
lights when the sync stops. So when you stop the sync, your lights can go to a certain setting. I love

45
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,960
this option. I set my lights to dim because I'm most likely you can be using the sync box at night.

46
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,000
Once your entertainment area is set up, it's time to switch back to the Hue Sync app. From there,

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,400
you'll have the ability to choose the sync mode, the intensity, the brightness, and finally begin the sync.

48
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,320
All right. The time has come. Let's see how this thing works. Let's get lit.

49
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,840
So there are four intensity modes on the sync box and I'm going to show you all of them side by side.

50
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,440
First, we're going to start by playing a video on my Apple TV. I really wanted to play like Marvel

51
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,280
Avengers or something like that, but copyrights can be difficult with Disney. So you know what? Why

52
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,919
don't we just play some random video on YouTube? This is familiar. We were ready to plug into the virtual world.

53
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:09,440
So for those of you who don't know what this video is, it's a video on the void VR. This awesome

54
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,880
VR experience that I checked out. You should totally watch the video of your at all interest. So as you

55
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,600
can see, there are a lot of different ways to have your sync box set up. I'd say for me, after watching

56
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,240
video content with a box for a week, I found that I liked the moderate setting with half brightness,

57
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,000
the best for video content. The mini-games were fun, quirky, and simple yet strategic. At one point,

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,800
we were shooting pancakes and milkshakes at cats and puppies. Next, let's play some video games.

59
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,440
In this clip, I'm playing the game Astral Chain on Nintendo Switch. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed

60
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,040
playing the games with the sync box. The colors flow seamlessly as I moved from dark to light areas

61
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:54,400
and truly added to my video game experience. Next up, music. I took a song from my music library and

62
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,600
interplayed it to my Apple TV and set the sync box to extreme.

63
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,240
I love how the lights interact with the beat of the music. I can absolutely see myself using this

64
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,440
when I have parties. What's definitely lacking here is the ability to set the color palette.

65
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,000
Here's sync on the computer allows you to do this and I miss it here. I reached out to Philips

66
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,720
you and they said they planned to include this in the future. Okay, so now for my final thoughts.

67
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,280
With the Philips you play HDMI sync box, you are getting an entire home entertainment lighting

68
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,520
ecosystem. You could switch between devices seamlessly, control the mode, brightness, and intensity,

69
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,120
and you can set a number of user preferences. Some of what you didn't even know you wanted. I was impressed

70
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,120
by how much I enjoyed this box. There's literally no lag between the light and the content on your TV.

71
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:56,080
The Philips you sync box is $230 and I realize that's not cheap. But if you're looking to invest

72
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,040
in your Philips view system that you already have built, it's worth it. This is going to greatly

73
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:07,040
enhance your entertainment experience. The lack of HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos

74
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,560
is a disappointment here. But for someone who doesn't have those implemented, this is a no-brainer.

75
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,320
This is a sophisticated device and I can't think Philips you enough for putting so much thought into it.

76
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,200
Like seriously Philips you, you guys are awesome. This was a great job and I'm excited to see what

77
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,840
