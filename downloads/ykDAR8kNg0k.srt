Hey everyone in case you didn't know there is a pandemic going on COVID-19 also known as the coronavirus

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,260
It's going around freaking everyone out freaking me out little anxious. It's raining outside in LA. The world is over

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:21,800
Just kidding. Everything's gonna be fine, but I wanted to come out with some videos that are gonna help us all get through this pandemic together because

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,840
This is scary

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,360
So one thing that we all need to make sure we're doing is wash our hands thoroughly

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,900
We've all been doing that I think, but you know what you know what it's not being washed

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,640
Our phones. Yeah, we're all about washing our hands, but then you go to trade or jose and you get to pick up the cereal and then

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,400
You pick up your phone and then you put in your pocket and then you wash your hands and you're like I'm good

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,580
Take out your phone, put it to your face talking to your mom, and then it's ever weird germs are everywhere

10
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,040
You're nasty

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:00,460
Little nasty. Thanks, Raven. So I've done some research and here's what I found. A toilet seat has

12
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:04,940
1200 bacteria per square inch a kitchen counter has

13
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,380
1700 and 36 a pet food dish has

14
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,180
2,110 a door knob. You know that's gotta be dirty a door knob has

15
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,900
8600

16
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:20,539
Well, you know what your phone has 25,000 bacteria on it

17
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,820
That is gross. That's why I made this video

18
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,380
I'm gonna tell you different ways to clean your phone right here we go

19
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,340
So the first tech tip which is actually super high tech and I'm really excited about it

20
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,300
And I want to get one myself are these UV sanitizers

21
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:41,400
So there's one called phone soap UV C sanitizer and basically what you do is you can put your phone inside of that and it will charge it

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,980
And it takes about 10 minutes, but it will use UV rays to clean your phone

23
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,580
They say that this kills 99.99% of germs

24
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:55,340
But I do know that it's not necessarily proven to kill the coronavirus. They haven't I don't think they tested for that

25
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,580
But I think that you know what while we're on this like germ a germ a foe

26
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:06,100
Moment I don't know why not a get a UV ray sanitizer and clean your phones the nasty

27
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:12,740
Second way to do it is a DIY way to do it and this is something that anyone can do if you have 70%

28
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:22,180
Ice a propel alcohol. I think I'm saying that correctly basically rubbing alcohol. You have to mix 60% rubbing alcohol with 40% water

29
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:30,860
No, that's wrong. You got to mix 40% ice a propel alcohol with 60% water

30
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,460
Make sure that's what you do. So you mix those together

31
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,460
I actually went to CVS to go get some and they are completely sold out

32
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,260
So I don't have any show you you're gonna put those together and then you can dip any

33
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,820
Micro cloth I think I actually have one of those

34
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:52,500
I do it's just not easily accessible at the moment. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna get that

35
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,859
You're gonna mix those two together and then you're gonna use one of those micro cloths

36
00:02:56,179 --> 00:03:00,980
Basically you don't want anything with the lint and you can rub it all over your phone

37
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:06,340
Just make sure you don't hit any of like the porous areas those holes or the charging port or speakers

38
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,220
Try to go around that and then the last way Apple just updated their guidelines for how to clean

39
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,620
Your phone and you can use 70% ice propel alcohol white or a clorox white

40
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,620
18 t basically says the same thing but by spraying it onto a cloth and

41
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:27,500
Samsung hasn't said anything and again don't do it over the speakers and the charging port and also that your part

42
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,420
Where you listen to it's also a speaker. So there you guys have it

43
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,380
I hope you guys found that helpful if you did want to give it a like right down there and for more

45
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:48,859
I'm gonna tell you the best tech to have on you to get through this pandemic especially if you're quarantined

46
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,540
So I hope you're not and I definitely am not but I'm under like super self quarantine

47
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,540
We're like I just am not gonna leave my house

48
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:04,220
No reason to that means I will be making a lot of videos from right here. So stay tuned for that

49
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,220
