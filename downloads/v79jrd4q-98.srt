00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Hey YouTube, I have some huge news.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,760

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,560
I am inlated.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,240
I want to thank you guys because you guys are supporting my dreams.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,600
I want to give you some stuff.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,280
Okay. How about that?

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:15,920
All right.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,760
This is not a sponsored ad.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,360
I had reached out to this company called My Sticker Faced.

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,080
What do they do?

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,560
They make stickers of your face.

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,600
Kind of like this.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,480
Took that out.

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,400
My Sticker Faced sent me.

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,400
Basically, a lifetime supply of stickers of my face.

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,200
And also my nephew, baby Kevin, who is the cutest dog ever.

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,720
Oh, she's such a good boy.

18
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,920
Oh, she's such a good boy.

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,840

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,120
I had this really sweet letter that the My Sticker Faced sent me.

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,600
It says that they can't wait to see what I create.

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,120
This is what I'm creating.

28
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,720
And then we have the team right there.

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,400
That's the team. I love that.

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,360
There's a sticker for it.

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,480
One in a little puppy.

32
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,200
That's so cute.

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,560
They're actually based on Long Island,

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,400
which is where I'm proud to think that's awesome.

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,400
So I know it may seem super vain to have a bunch of stickers of your face on it.

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,480
But it's not like I have a shirt like that, too.

37
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,440
Anyway, I have written this segment to show you guys the top five ways to stick your

38
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,400
your face.

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
First way to stick your your face.

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,440
Mark your things.

41
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,600
Stick your items specifically that are often taken by people because they think it's there.

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,440
Stick your your pens, your pencils, your phone case, your phone charger.

43
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,320
That's a good one.

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,680
Everyone always thinks it's theirs.

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,920
No, it's not because you face this on me.

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,040
Second way.

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,320
Stick your face.

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,280
Goody bag.

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,440
That's actually how I found my sticker face.

50
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,039
It's my awesome friend Julie, made goody bags for all my friends.

51
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,039
I'm like a weekend getaway for my birthday.

52
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:02,000
Every goody bag had a booklet of stickers of my face and also had like these little big lighters because

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,079
my friends love lighting candles, both recreational and prescription.

54
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:09,199
Third way.

55
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,640
This is really my favorite way to use the stickers, writing a letter.

56
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,800
So if you're writing a letter to someone, when you sign your name, also put a sticker your face.

57
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,560
And you know what, when you're sealing up that envelope, say it you spit and use a stick

58
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,360
to seal it fourth way.

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,200
Dishware, you know what I have right here?

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,640
An enviable coffee mug that keeps my coffee warm.

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,320
And you know what, I don't want you touching it.

62
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,000
So I'm going to put a sticker of my face on it.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,480
You can use these stickers on dishware because they're microwave state and dishwasher safe.

64
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,280
And there you go.

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
No one's ever going to take you thermos.

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,080
It's mine.

67
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,960
Goody bag.

68
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,200
Now for the final and fifth way.

69
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,640
But nine graffiti.

70
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,160
You're going to be putting your face on your friend's things.

71
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,760
So next time your friend goes to brush their teeth, they're going to see a cute little picture

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,000
of you on it vibrating around their mouth.

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,560
Oh, do they have some really cute conditioner?

74
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,800
Make sure it's even cuter with your face on it.

75
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,600
And don't worry, they have this great vinyl material for easy application and removal.

76
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,680
What if a friend passes out of the party?

77
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,359
Don't put a sharpie on their face.

78
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:12,240
Put a sticker of your face on their face.

79
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,840
