1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Diabetes is a lot to take in, especially after diagnosis.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,920
The flood of new terms, tech, and lifestyle changes can feel totally overwhelming.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,000
It's like being dropped into a game with a complicated tutorial.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,440
And you're expected to beat the boss battle on day one.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,360
But what if I told you there was a fun and intuitive tutorial available right now to help

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,360
with diagnosis?

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,720
Well, a new smartphone app called Level 1 is aiming to be just that.

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:36,860
A fun game-ified way to make Type 1 diabetes education easier to understand for newly diagnosed

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,760
patients and their families.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,760
Welcome to the show.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,760
I'm Justin.

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,760
I have Type 1 diabetes in on here.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,760
I talk all things.

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,800
Diabetes tech, news, and research, and I am a gamer.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,239
So I got super excited when I heard about this app, and I played it myself.

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,520
Today I'm joined by Sam Glassenberg, a veteran video game developer, and father of a child

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,840
with Type 1.

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,280
And that's what inspired him to make this game.

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,560
He created Level 1 to help others navigate the early stages of diabetes management through interactive

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,080
levels that teach everything from insulin to car ratios to how exercise and fatty foods affect

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,080
blood sugar.

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,080
Health care providers and patients are already raving about this app, and now it is available

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,840
to everyone on the app store, whether it's Google or Apple.

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:29,000
And after playing about 10 levels myself, I can confidently say that I wish I had this app when

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,440
I was first diagnosed.

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,120
Keep in mind that this show is not medical advice and it's for educational purposes only.

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,440
Always consult with a physician before making changes to your health care.

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,440
All right.

29
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,440
Let's get into it.

30
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,440
Sam, welcome to the show.

31
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,440
It's good to have you here.

32
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
No.

33
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,440
Great to be here.

34
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
Thank you for having me.

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,200
So little thing about me that you may not know is that I almost went to school for video

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,720
game design at Northeastern, but it was a last minute decision to not, and I'm glad I didn't

37
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,800
because then I probably wouldn't be where I am today.

38
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,960
But I love video games.

39
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
I'm a gamer.

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,360
I'm playing last of us part one right now, which I'm really enjoying on my PlayStation portal.

41
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,360
Yeah.

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
Gamer to gamer.

43
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,000
I want to hear all about the work that you've done, but before we get into Level 1, tell

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,080
me a little bit about your background and how you, you know, I guess your background

45
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,480
in video game design.

46
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
Sure.

47
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,720
So I've spent my career in video games.

48
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,200
My first job was out of college was at LucasArts.

49
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
I was hired as an animator.

50
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,320
I flew spaceships for cutscene animations in PlayStation to Star Wars games.

51
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,120
After that, I used to run a game technology team at Microsoft.

52
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,040
I built a company that did games for Hollywood movies, Hunger Games, Mission Impossible,

53
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
Rocky.

54
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,040
And for the last 10 years, I've built a company called Level X, which actually makes video games

55
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,520
for doctors.

56
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,440
Very cool.

57
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,880
I think what I love about video games so much is that they test you, they push you, you need

58
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,320
to use critical thinking to get through puzzles.

59
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,440
It's not as relaxing or as simple as watching a movie, right?

60
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,200
They put you to the test.

61
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:25,799
So I guess why would you say video games are a good tool for teaching and learning?

62
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:28,680
They are the best tool for teaching and learning.

63
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,120
Humans have evolved to learn this way.

64
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,959
I mean, think about it, when you get a phone or anything, you don't read the manual.

65
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,280
I don't even think they've even come with manuals anymore.

66
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,560
You go, I need to play with this.

67
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,880
Why is this?

68
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,920
We have evolved to learn through play.

69
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,040
And in the video games industry, we have kind of figured out that neurochemical recipe.

70
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,920
For exactly what you describe.

71
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,600
How do you hit the right balance of reward and frustration, challenge and skill to keep you

72
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:04,720
in the flow state and literally maximize the release of neurochemicals in the brain to maximize

73
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,080
fun, but also maximize learning.

74
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,760
Happy to like, I have a lot of examples, sort of the neuroscience of angry birds and things

75
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
like that sort of explain.

76
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Give us that example.

77
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
That's a cool one.

78
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
I love angry birds.

79
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Oh, yeah.

80
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,040
So if you've ever wondered why angry birds are so addicted, I mean, people, the game came out

81
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
10 years ago.

82
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,720
I still see people playing it on airplanes today.

83
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,120
We've evolved to play angry birds.

84
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,680
What do I mean by that?

85
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,600
So just a thing back to the first time you play angry birds probably a while ago.

86
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
What happened?

87
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,240
Angry birds hops in the slingshot.

88
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,320
You aim at the tower of pigs.

89
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
You fired.

90
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,480
What happened the first time you played?

91
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,440
I killed some pigs.

92
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,440
Not the first time.

93
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,440
The first time you missed.

94
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
Yes.

95
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,040
And what happens when you miss the piggy's laugh at you?

96
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
Why?

97
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Why?

98
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
Why?

99
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Why?

100
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,039
Why?

101
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:55,039
Why?

102
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:56,039
Why?

103
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,039
This totally gratuitous.

104
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:58,039
Why?

105
00:04:58,039 --> 00:04:59,039
This makes you frustrated.

106
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:00,039
Second bird hops in.

107
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:01,039
You aim a little better.

108
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,039
You fire.

109
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,039
You get closer to the tower.

110
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,039
But you still miss.

111
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:06,039
And you get more frustrated.

112
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,039
Third bird.

113
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,360
There's glorious.

114
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,480
There's explosions and animations and the pigs go flying in the music changes.

115
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,880
All of this, all of this, was deliberately designed to trigger a dopamine release in your

116
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,560
brain that reinforces those neural connections used on that last successful fire.

117
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,160
This is why.

118
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,560
An hour later, you're firing that bird between two narrow obstacles at 50 meters.

119
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,760
And like 80 hours later, you're still playing the game.

120
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,200
Now, we didn't invent this, we didn't invent this in our mechanic in the games industry.

121
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,240
It's existed in the mammalian neuron for tens of millions of years.

122
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,159
This is how our ancestors learned how to throw a spear.

123
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:48,480
Miss, miss, miss, frustration, frustration, hit, dopamine.

124
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,440
Okay, what are the neural connections we used on that last successful throw?

125
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,320
We want to make those thicker.

126
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,159
We're going to want to use those again.

127
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,640
In video games, like what's Angry Birds doing?

128
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,960
It's training your brain, how to predict the flight, the parabolic flight of an angry bird.

129
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
What's seem city doing?

130
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,640
It's training your brain to understand how a city works.

131
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
It's level one doing.

132
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,719
It's training your brain, how to manage diabetes.

133
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:09,719
Yeah, yeah.

134
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:17,880
I've played Angry Birds in so many different forms from iPhone, back in maybe that was 2014.

135
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,159
And then I played in VR and I even played in augmented reality with the magic leap headset,

136
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:28,159
which was a really cool way to experience it because it's like you put an Angry Birds game

137
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:32,120
on your table and you're playing Angry Birds in your space, which is cool.

138
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,280
Box would fall off the table and hit the floor.

139
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,880
This was really high tech stuff.

140
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,120
And I actually talked all about that on just in tech, which was my, what I was doing before

141
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,200
diet, that tech, which was all technology and it was a lot of fun and I love tech.

142
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,200
I love gaming and that's now a more private part of my life, which is nice.

143
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
It's not my work.

144
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,560
I get to do diabetes, which is my work now.

145
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
For me, I'm very lucky.

146
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
It's both.

147
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Yeah, right.

148
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
Right.

149
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
It was amazing.

150
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,080
We actually, back, you know, level X for, for, for doctors, we have like, we built some

151
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,360
bunch of the launch medical content for magic leap and AR core and AR kid and a bunch of these

152
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
things.

153
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,520
So we have, you know, you can, you can do spine surgery, you know, on a spine that's floating

154
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,800
and you can actually just do it with the controllers.

155
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
It's crazy stuff.

156
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Yeah.

157
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,640
If anyone is interested in seeing, I did a whole five part series with magic leap and talked

158
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:30,599
about all the cool experiences and apps for it were, and the technology still holds

159
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:31,599
up.

160
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,760
Like it was very advanced at the time, so it's kind of like now is when it's all kind of happening

161
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,120
especially with the Apple Vision Pro.

162
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,360
So I'll throw that in the show notes.

163
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,880
Your company level X, you, you design games for doctors, tell me a little bit about what those

164
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,000
games are and who they're for.

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,599
So look, the, like, what level X does is they said, make games for medical professionals.

166
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,000
So if you think about, so imagine we would really have millions of medical professionals playing

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,920
video games to, you know, they're earning continuing medical education credit toward renewing

168
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
their medical license.

169
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
They play games.

170
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,840
We have, when you think about diagnosing rare disease, that's a puzzle game.

171
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,680
When you think about managing a complex patient with multiple comorbidities, that's a strategy game.

172
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,920
And so we basically bring in the top game developers, designers, artists who worked on everything

173
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:29,320
from mortal combat to diner dash, we team them up with hundreds of physician advisors across

174
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,920
every major therapeutic area in medicine to, we say, advance the practice of medicine through

175
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
play.

176
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,920
To use video game tech and video game design to help accelerate the adoption of new techniques,

177
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,920
new products, and that's, that's what we do.

178
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,720
Now we, with diabetes, have expanded also into games for patients.

179
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,320
Yeah, you told me you had to convince your parent company to let you do this.

180
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,320
Tell me why, why, why that was so important to you.

181
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,120
So this is the, this is sort of the story of how level one came about.

182
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,120
In the middle of, you know, I'm halfway into the level X journeys, five years ago, my at the time,

183
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,320
five year old daughter was diagnosed with type one.

184
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:17,920
And the onboarding experience was not great.

185
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,520
And so on Friday, your life is normal.

186
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,120
And then within 24 hours, oh, hey, Sam, you thought your job was running video game companies.

187
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Oh, that's your second job.

188
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,960
Yeah, primary job is you're now a pancreas and you need to inject what is a lethal drug in

189
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,760
insulin into your kid and to precise don't precise doses, you know, dozen times a day.

190
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,560
I call it like this one sheet, I call it the guide to not killing your own kid.

191
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,360
We're out of the hospital in 48 hours, because my wife's a pediatrician, she caught it early.

192
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,360
And we're out of the hospital.

193
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,760
They give us a, here's this thing.

194
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,960
It's got scribbled out carb ratios, insulin sensitivity factors, you know, all this guidance on how to

195
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:10,160
pre-bullet, it took me a year and it took us a year to actually develop a mental model to understand

196
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,960
how to manage this disease.

197
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
Finally, after you're like, oh, I get it.

198
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Yeah, insulin curves and action curves and digestion speeds.

199
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Okay, now my brain knows where that curve is going to go.

200
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,360
And I was like, well, this is stupid.

201
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,960
Like why should you have to do this?

202
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,960
We're learning, we're learning how to manage diabetes through play, but the play is trial and error on your own

203
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,960
kid, or for many other people, it's on themselves.

204
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,460
And this is terrible.

205
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,460
So we fixed it.

206
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:45,960
I put together a design and at the time, so a level actually been acquired by a major medical device company

207
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:52,960
and, you know, called BrainLab, they do, you know, all the cool, like neurosurgery hardware and software,

208
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,960
but they also do a lot of philanthropic efforts in health care worldwide.

209
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
I was like, hey, this is super important to me.

210
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:05,960
I want to get this game done and they fund it to their credit and so we built it and launched it two weeks ago.

211
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,960
This episode is sponsored by OmniPod.

212
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:14,960
As someone with T1D and with an incredibly active lifestyle, it's important for me not to get tied up,

213
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,960
especially with tubes on my insulin pump.

214
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,960
I love to go swimming, lift weights and play kickball with friends.

215
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,960
And with OmniPod 5, I never have to worry about tubes getting in the way.

216
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:31,960
Plus, not having to disconnect helps me to stay in range during all of my favorite physical activities.

217
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
That includes sexy time, too.

218
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,960
See if you're eligible for a 30 day trial by visiting OmniPod.com slash dive tech on there.

219
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,960
You'll see full safety and risk information and trial terms.

220
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,960
That's OmniPod.com slash dive tech.

221
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:52,960
So I can imagine as a parent, like it must be really stressful to have to learn all of this new information

222
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,960
when your child's diagnosed and have to manage their pancreas.

223
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,960
I mean for me, it was so overwhelming.

224
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,960
It really did take that full year to feel like I got all of these different areas of diabetes down.

225
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:10,960
And I've always looked at my diabetes as a really annoying game.

226
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,960
It really is a game of like, add a little of this, reduce a little of this to keep you in this range.

227
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,960
Like, like, flappy bird, right?

228
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Yeah.

229
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Or that this helicopter game I used to play, which was essentially floppy bird.

230
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:29,960
And I can just imagine someone like you, you were immediately, as you were taking all this information,

231
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,960
like, game of fighting in your brain a little bit.

232
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,960
Tell me a little bit about these early days of when you were doing this,

233
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,960
how you were thinking about all of this.

234
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,960
I mean, I'm sure it was so stressful, but like, were you already kind of toying around with things like,

235
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,960
Oh, this is like, game of fighting in your head?

236
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,960
So not yet, at the very beginning, what's interesting is, so first off, I hardly remember the beginning,

237
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
because you don't sleep much when you're the parent.

238
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,960
But what I did was actually wrote it down, and I wrote a little bit of a diary,

239
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,960
because what was interesting was not like thinking about it from the perspective of like,

240
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
how would I make a game to solve this?

241
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,960
I wasn't there yet.

242
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,960
But what was interesting for me is coming from video games.

243
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:12,960
We've gotten extremely good at, they're all these rules around video game design.

244
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,960
How do you make a game fun?

245
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,960
How do you bring people into a video game and introduce them to the game such that,

246
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,960
because obviously there's a thousands of games launching in the app store like every month.

247
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,960
So how do you make it?

248
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,960
So your game stands out.

249
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
So people start playing it immediately.

250
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,960
They start having a good time, and they get into it, and it's engaging.

251
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,960
And there's all this neuroscience and design to do this.

252
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:42,960
What I realized was the experience of type 1 diabetes takes all of those rules around how to make a fun and

253
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:51,960
thralling, captivating video game, and flips them all in their head to make the most punishing experience possible.

254
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,960
Little things like, there's rules and video games.

255
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
You always want to give the player an early win.

256
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,960
So you notice when you play a new game, there's some little thing you do, and it's like,

257
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,960
oh, congratulations, you just beat a boss.

258
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,960
There's some early win, diabetes, the exact opposite.

259
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,960
Also in video games, it's very important that player understands what they're being scored on and what that score means.

260
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,960
So type 1 diabetes, you start already you're losing.

261
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,960
If you're, you know, luckily we're in in D.K.A., but like, you know, blood sugar is 550.

262
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
You don't even know what that means.

263
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,960
Like, keep a little bit of anyone else.

264
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,960
You don't know what that means.

265
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
All you know is you have a score.

266
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
Your score is bad.

267
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,960
And the score is really important for gameplay.

268
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
And then from there, it's just all downhill.

269
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Like the, you know, whether it's the instruction manual, which is terrible.

270
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,960
Whether it's the, you know, all the different we call the loops of fingerpokes and

271
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:48,960
injections, and it's all, you know, so I actually wrote a blog that I, you know, eventually posted,

272
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:54,960
called worstgameever.org that literally just goes through the sort of day by day as a game,

273
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,960
you know, from a game design perspective on why the onboarding experiences terrible.

274
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,960
I wrote it because it was therapeutic for me, but a lot of other parents have been reading it like early on.

275
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,960
And they're just like, well, it's great to know that others were sufferers, others suffer like you do.

276
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:15,960
Yeah, you know, I'm a pretty competitive person, not a sort of loser, but I like to get super competitive about games.

277
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:21,960
And I like games where you can, there's like real strategy to being good at it.

278
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,960
And yes, diabetes, yes, their strategy.

279
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:32,960
Yes, there's different features and modes you can turn on and adjustments and preparation you can do.

280
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,960
But no matter how good you are at the game of diabetes, it will always school you.

281
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,960
Yep, in a way you don't expect.

282
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,960
You cannot perfections impossible.

283
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
It just is.

284
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,960
We, because we move and we eat and we breathe.

285
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,960
You know, it was like doing what there was something like doing the same thing.

286
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,960
The eating the exact same thing and doing the exact same thing for three days and getting completely different results.

287
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,960
That's what type one diabetes.

288
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:08,960
And so in video games, that breaks the rules because in video games you always want the player to know how their actions correlate to their score in the game.

289
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,960
And you want it to be consistent and diabetes is not that.

290
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:21,960
So even when we designed level one, like one thing that was very important is you can three star any level without a perfect score without being in range of whole time.

291
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Because it's very important that first few days to really internalize like perfection is impossible.

292
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Don't try it.

293
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,960
If you try it, you will actually just stress yourself out because you can't.

294
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,960
As long as you're within range 90% of the time, you're happy.

295
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,960
You can three star every level and level one.

296
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,960
Because our whole thing is do not like, how do we literally create a game that trains your brain?

297
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,960
Like, no, no, no, you don't want it.

298
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
You don't need to be perfect.

299
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
Relax.

300
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
So it's a really pretty looking game.

301
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,960
I know that you were inspired by different art types of games.

302
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Tell me a little bit about, you know,

303
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,960
the inspiration behind the style of the game and what the game style is.

304
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Yep.

305
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,960
So the, there's the mechanics and the visuals.

306
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,960
The mechanics, we call it the gameplay.

307
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,960
Super simple.

308
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
You play the whole game just with one thumb.

309
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
One handed, one thumb.

310
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,960
We don't want you to have to spend an hour learning out of play the game.

311
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,960
We want you to know how to play the game intuitively and spend your time learning out of managed diabetes.

312
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
The game is a particle, fundamentally a particle puzzle.

313
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,960
It's a particle game.

314
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,960
If you've ever played feed meat oil, wears my water, a world of goo,

315
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,960
like these games are played by a billion people.

316
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
They're super fun.

317
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,960
You have thousands of particles on screen that interact in interesting ways.

318
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
It's gorgeous.

319
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Our brain delights in it.

320
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
That's why we love playing with sand.

321
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,960
And so I humans love playing with water and magnetic sand and things.

322
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,960
Because we delight in complex particle interactions.

323
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
So the game is just gorgeous.

324
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
And what you're doing is in the game.

325
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
You're also, it's also a rhythm game.

326
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,960
So if you're familiar with, like, I think guitar hero is that genre.

327
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
So what is dosing diabetes?

328
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:06,960
It's making sure to time your doses with whatever's going on with the food with your current blood glucose level.

329
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,960
And so the game is just like it's super simple to play.

330
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
All you're doing is tapping with your thumb, dosing insulin.

331
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,960
Once a while if you go low, you move your thumb a centimeter to the left and you dose some juice.

332
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
And the game just represents everything.

333
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
So there's 60 levels.

334
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,960
There's food that's just moving in on a conveyor belt.

335
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,960
Dropping into your digestive system.

336
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Getting broken down to these gorgeous glucose particles.

337
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,960
You inject insulin.

338
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
It comes in off the side.

339
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Activates the cells and just sucks in the, sucks in the glucose.

340
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
It's gorgeous.

341
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,960
It's captivating.

342
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,960
The visual style is super light and casual.

343
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Kind of think candy crush.

344
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,960
Because we really wanted to make something that was going to be, you know, a visual style, like everyone plays candy crush.

345
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,960
So we picked visual styles that are like very casual, very friendly.

346
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,960
You're usually already under a lot of stress when you're trying to learn about this.

347
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:07,960
So the whole theme is just very, the soundtrack is very zen and you just play the game for two hours.

348
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,960
And you've mastered every major topic that you need for the first six months of MDI.

349
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,960
Yeah, it's a really pretty looking game and somewhat relaxing playing it.

350
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Like you can take in all of this information and enjoy yourself and not feel like too stressed.

351
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Sam, so during development, how are you making sure that what you were doing was correct.

352
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:41,960
Like were you working with other people, doctors, HCPs to play levels and things like that to make sure that the information you were putting out was correct.

353
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,960
Yes, so this is level X is what we do all the time, right.

354
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,960
So we work with hundreds of physician advisors and contributors.

355
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,960
We have biomedical engineers and MDs on staff.

356
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,960
So obviously making games for doctors, it's going to be.

357
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,960
So we know how to make really games that are accurate and that are peer reviewed and so forth.

358
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:13,960
We started out, you know, with obviously all the publications, the peer reviewed papers around, you know, insulin action curves and glucose and, you know, all the glucose dynamics.

359
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:27,960
So it's modeled after real science, but then of course we ran a beta for I think over a year or not a year where we had hundreds of endocrinologists, diabetes, educators, camp counselors, newly diagnosed parents.

360
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Everybody and we're just internalizing all the feedback on the game.

361
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:39,960
Just like you would in any game, you know, make sure it's balanced, but also make sure that it's that it's not only like medically accurate in terms of the glucose behavior.

362
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,960
Fine, got it, but even just making sure that like all the messaging and all the.

363
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,960
You know, we weren't doing anything that might sort of nudge somebody in the wrong direction.

364
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,960
Yeah, I can imagine there are things you could say that could hurt someone, you know, if it's said the wrong way.

365
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:05,960
Yeah, or even just subtly like one of the things I remember in the game we had for a while, like really slow digesting foods.

366
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,960
We would actually be had a level where it taught you how to do multiple injections.

367
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:19,960
Like you with, you know, we put the pump, you might, you know, have multiple boluses or, you know, you might actually do an injection later if you have a really slow digesting food.

368
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:26,960
And the feedback that we got from it is, yes, it's correct, but such a small percentage of the population will actually ever do that.

369
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,960
Don't even try like it's too much for people and we pull those levels out.

370
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:48,960
Yeah, so I've played this game. I played at least the first 10 levels and I plan to play through all of them because I'm really curious to see myself how each level changes and there's some interesting levels that I do want to get into with you to just hear more about them.

371
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:59,960
So that everyone can hear too, but who is this game for? Like, obviously when I was playing and I was like, I know a lot of this, but I was only really in the first 10 levels. I see how it complex this is getting.

372
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:14,960
Who do you see using this? Is this someone who a parent, a person with diabetes who is just diagnosed or is this could this even be for people that are like, I want to brush up on this or things that maybe people never even learned, you know, maybe in there.

373
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,960
Yes, and yes, so the primary audience is the newly diagnosed and their caregivers.

374
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,960
Because that was my personal experience. What we're seeing over time is that actually the audience for this is much bigger.

375
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:34,960
So the design point again is, you know, the newly diagnosed and their caregivers and, you know, you can even see that like the reading level is as low as possible, which is make it.

376
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
So the broadest audience can play.

377
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:44,960
I needed it because, you know, camp counselors like, I don't let babysitters babysit my daughter unless they've played at least through level 10.

378
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:54,960
There's just, that's interesting. That's very cool. Right? Think of all the people that need to know how to manage this disease, grandparents and camp counselors.

379
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,960
So it's for all of them, but we're also starting to realize is the audience is even even bigger than that.

380
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:08,960
So you can just look at the comments and feedback people are like, I've had this disease for five years and I learned like something I didn't know in level 20.

381
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:16,960
Especially things like how ketones work and exercise like there's a bunch of it gets fairly complex.

382
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:24,960
And the other thing that we've also seen is the importance actually of educating medical professionals.

383
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:31,960
There's a huge percentage like half of diabetics in this country are managed like they're in a rural environment like they don't have it. There's no endo.

384
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:37,960
They're managed by primary care anesthesiologists are putting patients under who are on pumps.

385
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:44,960
And they're like all of these doctors that actually, and nurses and other things that might not be endos, but actually need to understand this disease.

386
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,960
So we've actually been getting pressure. Hey, can we get to certified for CME credit?

387
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,960
So doctors can get CME credit toward renewing their medical license from playing level 1.

388
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:06,960
Today's episode is sponsored by T1D Exchange. You can directly make an impact on diabetes health care treatments and technology by participating in the T1D Exchange registry.

389
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,960
It starts with the simple survey about your life with T1D and it only takes about 15 minutes.

390
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,960
After that, you'll have a personal portal with ongoing T1D study and survey opportunities.

391
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,960
Plus, some of these studies even offer compensation.

392
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,960
Signing up with the link in the show notes helps support my channel and it allows me to continue putting out free content.

393
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:34,960
You can sign up at t1dxchange.org slash diabetic or click that link in today's show notes.

394
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:42,960
Tell me about when you open up this app, what are the mechanics, what is the player doing, what are they seeing and what are they controlling?

395
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:52,960
So the game is super simple. You come in and there's a nurse who's the non-player character, the NPC and she just talks you through everything.

396
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,960
The first step is actually the first experience you usually have with diabetes, which is you come in and you're high.

397
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,960
And you can see the, you can see the CGM view at the top and she has your high. You got a dose insulin to bring it down.

398
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:12,960
And all you do is you, it shows you exactly how to do it. You take your thumb and you just tap the, there's an insulin needle to bottom screen. You tap it.

399
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:20,960
Drag over. I think to like two units or something goes in. You watch the insulin go in. You watch it activate the cells. You watch the glucose get sucked in.

400
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,960
It's like great. Now you just learn how to do insulin.

401
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Okay. Let's go from here. So she starts now. You have to deal with a few highs and how to correct.

402
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:41,960
Then food starts appearing. Then you have to start learning about pre-bolicing. Initially the foods just tell you, oh, for this, you know, food you're going to need right now a unit of insulin or two units of insulin.

403
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:50,960
Just a little tag above the food. But eventually that goes away and it just shows you the carb count and you have the carb ratio in the top of the screen.

404
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,960
Or you start with the carb ratio of 10. It's like now you got to divide by 10, figure out how many units.

405
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:02,960
You go. Now later on in the game, the carb ratio changes throughout the day. You have to keep an eye on it. You have to change what you're dividing by.

406
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:10,960
So the whole time this is happening, but your interface never changes. All you're doing is just tapping, like tapping the phone, dragging the insulin pen.

407
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,960
It's just you literally just on the phone with you thumb, twist the insulin pen, dose.

408
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,960
Wow. That gets me even more excited about playing through all of it too and seeing how the levels progress.

409
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:26,960
Let's talk about some of the levels. I scroll through into future chapters of the game that I haven't gotten to yet.

410
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:34,960
So I want to hear more about them. Let's start with sick days. Tell me about what that chapter is bringing into the game.

411
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,960
Keytones.

412
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:44,960
So this is this was confounding for me the first time, right? Because you're like, well, blood sugars normal.

413
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:51,960
But that's because you're not eating. And when you're so when you're sick, right? Your blood sugars often normal. You're not eating.

414
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,960
And what's happening is keytones are still forming in your bloodstream. So you can still go into, you can still start throwing up.

415
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,960
You can have like keytones levels. You can even go in a D.K. Without with being actually in range or fairly close to range.

416
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:10,960
And so what we do is we present a scenario where there's no food coming in the conveyor belt. You're not eating your sick. And keytones are forming.

417
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,960
And so you have to now, now we don't change the interface. Now you still have to play with those two buttons, juice and insulin.

418
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:24,960
But you have to keep introducing juice and insulin into the system because you watch, you need that insulin in the system to break up the ketones that start forming.

419
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,960
And then of course there's a giant yellow vortex that appears and sucks all the ketones out because you peed them out.

420
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:38,960
And so now what about fast food? Fast food is just training your brain on how to do.

421
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:47,960
So we've introduced carb counting. We've introduced carb ratios. You've introduced like a bunch of different concepts. Fast food is just training your brain. How to do that math quickly.

422
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,960
Well, does it, does it introduce like glycemic index and how that changes?

423
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,960
Because I think that that's something a lot of people don't fully understand is the difference between a cheeseburger and an apple.

424
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:08,960
And the way it will affect you at different times does the fast food address longer times to wait, you know, for it to go into the bloodstream.

425
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Yes, so different foods you see it shows you they digest the different speeds and we actually visualize that. So you'll notice like when there's juice or an apple it just kind of falls the glucose those glucose particles the sugar particles is fall through the gears.

426
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:28,960
And then when you have a slow digesting food like a cheeseburger, it's very, very, it's breaking up very, very slowly.

427
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:37,960
And so that helps your brain develop this mental model of like, oh, I really need to think about that insulin curve and how that's going to interact with the food that I'm eating.

428
00:28:38,960 --> 00:29:06,960
Yeah, what I love so much about all these different chapters addressing different aspects of diabetes is that when you're first diagnosed, when you're a parent who has a kid who's diagnosed, you don't have enough time to learn in that once every other week, once every week 30 minute meet appointment you have with a diabetes educator, it's simply impossible to to soak in all that information and to take it all in and.

429
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
Like.
