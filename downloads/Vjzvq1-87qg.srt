00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Welcome to a very special episode of The Diabetic Podcast.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,440
We are at ATTD in Amsterdam.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,520
I am joined by Endocrinologist David On.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,600
Thanks for coming back on the show.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,040
Yeah, it's always great to talk to you.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,720
It's always great to talk to you and Amsterdam.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,600
How sweet is that?

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,240
Of course.

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,440
Yeah, we did this last year and it was a great conversation.

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,200
I knew I had to have you come back on to talk about all of the big announcements.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,840
And this year felt really big.

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,920
There were so many big advancements this year that we do have a lot

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,920
to talk about.

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,840
Yeah, and some of that are directly relevant to you today with new software updates like Control

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,840
IQ Plus, for example.

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,840
Yeah.

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
Well, let's start with that.

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,840
Let's do it.

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,360
So, tandem announced their Control IQ Plus, well, that it will release to everyone

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,160
in the U.S.

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,040
I think one of the biggest things with this is just access to who can use it.

22
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,840
Well, we're some of the changes to, I mean, some of the ranges or the people that could use

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
it.

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,480
So, for some background context, at the same time that they announced approval of the

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,680
Control IQ Plus software update, it also got FDA approved for type 2 diabetes.

26
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,560
So that means the T-Slim and Moby now are FDA approved for type 2 diabetes.

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:20,800
So some of the software features of the Control IQ Plus upgrade are more tailored to expanding

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,160
the use of Control IQ for people with type 2 diabetes.

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,740
So for example, the maximum weight range is a lot higher now, because sometimes people

30
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,520
type 2 diabetes have higher body weights.

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,320
Also, the maximum total daily dose as well is much higher.

32
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,120
That goes all the way up to 200 units a day now.

33
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,120
Right, correct.

34
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,240
So, the total max total daily dose now is 200 units a day.

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,920
And that also will help people that are heavier, more insulin resistant type 2 diabetes.

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,320
And similarly, I think on the low end, the numbers got lower as well to be a little bit more

37
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,120
friendly towards younger patients and the pediatric population.

38
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,800
Yeah, it's two years and older can use it.

39
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Right.

40
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,360
And the weight, I think, goes as low as 20 pounds.

41
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
I think so.

42
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
Yeah.

43
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,600
And I think total daily dose might be 10 units.

44
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,760
There were also some big features that come to everyone who's using it and everyone who will

45
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,760
use it.

46
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,160
There was first extended bolus.

47
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,520
So this allows users to, I think, before it was two hours that you could extend a bolus.

48
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
That's right.

49
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,840
Now it's eight hours.

50
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,840
I think it's six hours.

51
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
No, it's eight hours.

52
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
I did it yesterday.

53
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
All right.

54
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Oh, yeah.

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
By the way.

56
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
Look at that.

57
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
Look at that.

58
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
That's pretty cool.

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
Yeah, no, it's eight hours.

60
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,840
I did it last night.

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
I believe it's funny.

62
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,840
So it's funny because I feel like two hours felt like not enough time to extend a bolus.

63
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Yeah.

64
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
And eight hours.

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
I was like, wow, that's a long time you have.

66
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,840
How will people benefit from an eight hour extended bolus?

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,840
Yeah.

68
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,440
So there's a few different types of patients.

69
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,440
I think that would benefit.

70
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,840
So gastroperresis is, that's when your digestion is slowed.

71
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
It's an unfortunate complication of diabetes sometimes.

72
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,840
So people are, some people are a lot slower to digest their food.

73
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:06,840
So the typical scenario where that happens is if you bolus for a meal, some people will actually go low and then come up later because their body just takes so long to digest and process that food into carbohydrates.

74
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,840
So those people benefit from extending their bolus.

75
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,840
Also certain foods like pizza, for example, is kind of renowned for having a double spike.

76
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
Right.

77
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,840
You get that initial spike from like the bread, but then there's a lot of cheese and fats and oils that also will have a delayed spike.

78
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,840
So it can be very helpful for foods that have like that dual spike pattern.

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
Yeah.

80
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:37,840
And if in case it wasn't clear what an extendable is does is not it extends that bolus for the set amount of time, but you set a percentage of how much you want immediately.

81
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,840
And then what percentage you want delivered over that time period.

82
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
So yeah.

83
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:52,840
So when you eat pizza or something that's super fatty, you'll get that initial amount and then work with your doctor to, you know, based off of how that will affect you, you know, initially.

84
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,840
And then what time period it will take to be released into the bloodstream for me.

85
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,840
Maybe it's about four to five hours for those high fatty foods.

86
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
Totally.

87
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,840
So a lot of people will do like half of it right up front and then half of it over say four hours or so.

88
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Yeah.

89
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,840
And what you said about gastroperiesus, people who were taking GLP ones, that's something that they,

90
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,840
that's what they deal with, right?

91
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,840
Yeah.

92
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
So can yes.

93
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,840
So GLP ones, like things like Ozenpek or Mount Jarrow, it can delay gastric emptying, which slows down your digestion.

94
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
So yes.

95
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,840
And those situations, if you're struggling with low blood sugar after a bolus, extending that bolus might help.

96
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,840
Next, there is temp basal.

97
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,840
So tell us about that update.

98
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Yeah.

99
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,840
So temp basals, I think, are a really cool feature that you're going to love.

100
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,840
So temp basals are not a new concept.

101
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,840
A lot of pumps had the ability to do temporary basals where you reduce or

102
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,840
increase your basal rate by a percentage for a set amount of time.

103
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,840
But what's neat about this new update is now you can do a temp basal while control like you is running.

104
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
So you still get the benefits of automation.

105
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,840
It will still increase or decrease your basal if necessary.

106
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,840
But say you're feeling sick or you're going through a part of your menstrual cycle where you're more resistant to insulin and you need more.

107
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,840
What you can do is you can set a temp basal for up to 72 hours.

108
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,840
And that means your baseline insulin delivery is going to go up by a percentage that you specify.

109
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,840
So it can go up to 250% of your normal basal rate.

110
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,840
And it can go as low as 0% of your normal basal rate.

111
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,840
But on top of that, the control like you algorithm will still adjust your insulin if necessary.

112
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
Yeah.

113
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
This is a really powerful feature.

114
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:34,840
One that I, myself and many people who are on open source systems and DIY systems have been using.

115
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
Right.

116
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,840
And benefiting from since like 2016.

117
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,840
But it's so great to see that a temp basal within automated insulin has come to an FDA clear systems.

118
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:51,840
I hope others other companies follow suit and not just when you're sick and not just during the menstrual cycle, which is amazing.

119
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
But also for workouts.

120
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,840
And I found that, you know, I've used FDA clear systems recently.

121
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,840
Many of them, including movie before control like you plus I have it now.

122
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:11,840
But for workouts, being able to lower your basal needs an hour before working out is what I need, especially when I'm doing cardio.

123
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
So being able to do that's amazing for me.

124
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Totally.

125
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,840
And you can still use exercise activity mode and then do the temp basal on top.

126
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
So that's really helpful.

127
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,840
And I actually first learned about this concept by one of my patients who basically was doing what Justin was talking about.

128
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
But he was doing it manually.

129
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,840
So he had he'd create a separate profile for when he would go running.

130
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,840
And then he would have to switch to that profile and then turn on control like you.

131
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,840
But now you can just turn on the temp basal and it should be pretty cool.

132
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Yeah.

133
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
That's what I was doing with my systems as well.

134
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,840
I had to make all these changes.

135
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
But now it's just a quick little change.

136
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,840
And then that's interesting.

137
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,840
I mean, I haven't worked out since I updated to control like you plus.

138
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,840
But I will probably do a temp basal and go to activity feature because that raises the target.

139
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,840
And then there are I think there are some changes to the object.

140
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,840
I think it makes it algorithm a little bit less aggressive as well.

141
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
Okay.

142
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
Next, there is the twist pump.

143
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Right.

144
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,840
And that is only coming to the US.

145
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,840
It is a brand new insulin pump that should be releasing quarter two.

146
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,840
They announced that the pump will be given through pharmacy benefit.

147
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
Right.

148
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,840
Can you tell us a little bit about what that looks like?

149
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
Yeah.

150
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,840
So quick background is most of the hardware pumps.

151
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,840
All the tube pumps before the sequel twist have gone through.

152
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,840
It's called DME.

153
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
It's sensor durable medical equipment.

154
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,840
And that's why you get it from a company like advanced diabetes supply or buy room or something like that.

155
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,840
And you can't just go to CVS and pick it up.

156
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,840
So when you're insurance looks at covering these types of things.

157
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,840
They view pharmacy benefit and hardware benefit as completely different silos.

158
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,840
And hardware benefit the downside to that.

159
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,840
And when I said hardware, I mean DME.

160
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,840
Is that that's when you get locked into these four-year pump contracts.

161
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,840
Right.

162
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:59,840
So with Ventronic and tandem, when you're on the pump, you can't get any other DME pump until your four-year warranty is up.

163
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,840
But Omnipod kind of blaze the way here in getting their Omnipod covered solely through pharmacy benefit,

164
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,840
which means that you don't have to worry about DME.

165
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,840
So you could have just gotten a Metronic pump yesterday.

166
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,840
And if you want to switch to Omnipod, you can walk into the pharmacy and get an Omnipod covered by your insurance.

167
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,840
So what SQL twist is doing is they're going to be the first DME pump that I know of.

168
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,840
Or I should say tube pump that I know of.

169
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,840
That is going to get be had through the pharmacy channel.

170
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,840
So same thing.

171
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:34,840
If you're even if you just got a tandem or a Metronic pump one year ago, you would be able to try out the twist immediately once it's out through pharmacy benefit.

172
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Yes.

173
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:43,840
And at least with tandem, one thing I'm taking advantage of right now is they have a 90-day return policy.

174
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
Correct.

175
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,840
But it's not working for you within 90 days.

176
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,840
You can send it back and you'll you'll get your money back.

177
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,840
And I like at least what what tandem's doing and what Omnipod and Twister doing.

178
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,840
They're making it very easy to at least just start on it.

179
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
Yes.

180
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Right out.

181
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,840
And then you know make a decision from there.

182
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,840
Of course on tandem after those 90 days if you decide to keep it you are stuck in that four year.

183
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Yeah.

184
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Another big thing with Twister or a big announcement came was their CGM.

185
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:18,840
That is the Libre 3 Plus that will be available or be the go to CGM on launch.

186
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:26,840
Now when I heard that news my first thought was the Libre 3 Plus can only connect to one device at a time.

187
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
Right.

188
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:36,840
So that means that that will go right to the pump and you won't have share function through an Abbott Libre app.

189
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:43,840
So I asked him my interview with Alan Lott then the CEO which you can go watch later this week.

190
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:50,840
I asked him you know how will parents be able to to view this because the pump is cleared for six years enough.

191
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,840
Well they're going to have a follow up on launch.

192
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Yeah.

193
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:01,840
And that's really important because obviously yeah being able to follow your child or have your spouse follow you is a huge deal.

194
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,840
And like Justin said that was that's one of the biggest limitations to using Libre in an AID system.

195
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,840
So right now the burden is on the pump companies to build in that sharing because the sensor can only share data to the pump.

196
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,840
It can't share it on its own to the phone.

197
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:23,840
So so beta bionic says something called bionic circle which kind of recreates that sharing capability.

198
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,840
And I believe tandem's working on something like that too.

199
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Well that's exciting because yeah they work with Libre to plus.

200
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,840
And then so does Omni pod and hopefully Omni pod also comes with with a share.

201
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,840
Yeah I don't yeah I'm not quite sure they may already have a share feature.

202
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,840
I'm not sure like right at the second.

203
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,840
Okay we're going to take a quick break because this show floor is officially closing.

204
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
It's getting a little crazy.

205
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
I close it down.

206
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,840
Yeah let's find another spot to be in.

207
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,840
So yeah we'll see you in a little bit.

208
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,840
This episode is sponsored by Omni pod.

209
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,840
You guys know that staying connected to the tech world is important to me.

210
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,840
But what's also important to me is my insulin pump.

211
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,840
Omni pod 5 is tubeless and waterproof.

212
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,840
Which means I never have to disconnect from automated insulin delivery.

213
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,840
Even when I take a shower, go swimming or go to the gym.

214
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Staying connected to my insulin pump means I'm spending more time in automated mode.

215
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Which ultimately helps me spend more time in range.

216
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,840
See if you're eligible for a 30 day trial by visiting Omni pod.com

217
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
slash diabetic on there.

218
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,840
You'll see full safety and risk information in trial terms.

219
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Again that's Omni pod.com slash diabetic.

220
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840
Let's get back into twist.

221
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,840
So I also asked the CEO about other CGM compatibility.

222
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:45,840
Because the loop algorithm that powers it comes from the we are not waiting community that wants interoperability.

223
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Like so I kind of framed it that way.

224
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840
I was like well what about other CGMs?

225
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
Why just wanted?

226
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,840
And he really said that it came down to the bandwidth that they have right now.

227
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
So he did say that.

228
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Libre 3 plus now but they want to bring other CGMs.

229
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,840
He did specifically say Dexcom.

230
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,840
So I wouldn't be surprised if we did see that in the near future for the system.

231
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Yeah and in my conversations with a sequel as well.

232
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,840
I think it's a big priority to them which is really exciting.

233
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Many of the people as part of the team actually came from the we are not waiting movement.

234
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,840
So I think it is interoperability is a huge deal.

235
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,840
I actually see that as kind of a win by bringing Libre first because so many other systems started with Dexcom.

236
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,840
It's kind of nice to see for the first time as a system start with Libre and then add Dexcom later.

237
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:38,840
But I agree I think it's going to come to that they're going to bring Dexcom into the fold and I hope other sensors like ever since and other sensors down the road.

238
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Speaking of Dexcom you went to their symposium and you mentioned they brought back data of the 15 day CGM that is now with the FDA.

239
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,840
What were the findings there?

240
00:12:51,840 --> 00:13:01,840
Yeah so it was kind of hot off the press one of the big announcements at this conference was Dexcom shared the results of their trial data that where they get the 15 day sensor approved.

241
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,840
So they had to show that it was accurate that it was reliable things like that.

242
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:12,840
And one of the things that I learned from that talk was they actually have an updated algorithm that's powering the G715 day.

243
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:20,840
And they shared that in that study the Mard which is the most commonly accepted measurement of accuracy was actually even better than the 10 day sensor.

244
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:27,840
So it had a Mard of 8.0% the traditional G7 has a Mard of 8.2%.

245
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,840
So they actually improved their accuracy metric presumably because of the updated algorithm.

246
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,840
So that's kind of I didn't know that was coming so that was cool.

247
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:43,840
It's funny you don't really think algorithm that often when you think just CGM you think algorithm it's my automated insulin system and how it uses those numbers.

248
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:54,840
But CGMs you were telling these CGMs have their own algorithm that they're using to clean up data that's going on in the background things that we don't see and we don't need to see really.

249
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:08,840
Yeah, what I'm wondering here is though it sounds like when they were testing the Mard of the new 15 day that it's really it could be just that new algorithm that helps make the the Mard better.

250
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:20,840
But I'd be curious to know if they put the new algorithm on the 10 day sensor and truly could tell us if there was any difference in accuracy when it comes to hardware.

251
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:29,840
And the length that you're wearing the CGM right right so a couple things I can think of from there so one I agree I kind of have the same question it's like wait.

252
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Like is this a software upgrade is this a hardware upgrade and as far as I can tell it's a pure software upgrade in the sense that I think the hardware of the G7 and the G7 15 day are going to be the exact same but it's like the software layer on top that we don't interact with right that algorithm that just and I were talking about.

253
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:53,840
Where it kind of cleans up the data and presents you with a number I think that part of it is cleaned up and is going to be a little bit more precise.

254
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:01,840
So yeah, but a part of me was like I remember sitting in my chair thinking wait like why don't they just bring the new updated algorithm to the 10 day G7.

255
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:08,840
Yeah, but at the same time to be fair I think they're going to transition probably everybody over I would think to the 15 day.

256
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:22,840
Yeah and I believe first of all that algorithm must be what is with the FDA right and can just put out a new algorithm update I think for for this medical device it needs to be cleared because it's such an important.

257
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,840
Yeah, it's a little bit outside of.

258
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Yeah, it's definitely but but you know I think they're trying to move forward and they're going to bring into their latest product.

259
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:50,840
So one other thing that surprised me at the conference when it comes to Dexcom was their collaboration with Novo Nordisk on a connection between Novo Nordisk smart hands and the Dexcom G7 now this is Europe only it just brings another smart pen into the market that works with this major CGM but also.

260
00:15:50,840 --> 00:16:02,840
The information from the smart pen goes directly into the G7 so I'm not as familiar with the Novo pen Dexcom partnership but I agree with Justin I think he's connected insulin pens.

261
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:10,840
They do prevent present a unique opportunity for people who aren't yet ready to go on a ID maybe they can't afford it maybe they don't want to go on a pump.

262
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:18,840
But they still want some benefits of automation or not automation but you know so they do want some benefits of having calculations done for them.

263
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:29,840
So you can take advantage of these smart pens or connected pens combine CGM data and then put like a bullish calculator on top and you can get some of the features of an insulin pump in a pen.

264
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:44,840
And it's cool to have other options because Metronic has done something similar with the Simplera CGM and the In Pen which they make so it's nice to have like different ecosystems and more alternative more alternatives in that space.

265
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Another device that surprised me this year that I was not expecting was new generation of pump from Calado the company is Vescentra and it's Calado 2.

266
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:09,840
So this pump that was already pretty small it's worn like a tandem movie it's adhered to the body and then a little tube coming out of it with the infusion site is one way to where you could also just you know put it in your pocket and have a longer tube.

267
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:33,840
And this new pump is like about 10% smaller it comes in a bunch of colors six colors and I like these new ones have a more matte finish the current Calado are very shiny a lot of the colors I mean they're pretty but they're like hot pink and like very bright blue and these are really a bit tone down like the pink is almost like a pearl pink with a nice matte finish so they look much more elevated.

268
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:53,840
They use the same in infusion sets and the company was saying that because this pump there are changes to it but because there are a lot of similarities that it could streamline the the process of submission for CE mark and currently it's only available in three countries France Netherlands and Germany.

269
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:05,840
They are planning to get CE mark and bring it to those but then their next phase is really getting it into the US through FDA clearance so that was exciting was everything that like stuck out to you with this pump.

270
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:18,840
I think the Calado just like as someone who's on you know on social media and the type one diabetes space like the Calado was the pump that I always get jealous about you know it's like you look and you see people sharing it from you know you're up and you're like that's a pretty cool looking pump.

271
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:33,840
So I agree with Justin I was telling him before we went on camera it's kind of like a blend of the omnipot five and the tandem movie it has like the versatility of the movie but it's a little bit more sleek and it's in its patch option than the movie so.

272
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:42,840
I love options so bring it on yeah it's a very sleek look similar to omnipot where omnipot doesn't have any.

273
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:52,840
Chris is in it you can't see like multiple parts it's an all in one right yeah whereas like something like the movie which I'm wearing has the what is that.

274
00:18:52,840 --> 00:19:00,840
The cartridge yeah the cartridge that's like one color then you've got the pump that's another color it's a little more medical looking calado kind of looks like.

275
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,840
Yeah piece of jewelry in in some ways and funny enough I'm wearing the colado adhesive right now.

276
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,840
Oh cool. So did you notice I'm wearing the movie and I'm not using.

277
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,840
Oh yeah.

278
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,840
I'm using a colado adhesive.

279
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:28,840
Yeah I found I found some yeah and it's it's a perfect size and also look at it look how it looks when I have my pump off it's not this like huge piece with like a plastic tray.

280
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:42,840
And then you know a whole piece of cloth that goes around it it's very simple so I do really like that and if you can find colado adhesive patches in your movies or I highly recommend of course you can wear mobile and your pockets well or clip it.

281
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:49,840
But business opportunity if you live in one of those three countries you can just start you know black market shipping amount to the United States.

282
00:19:49,840 --> 00:20:00,840
And I spoke to tandem and I asked them I said is your adhesive patch like an FDA thing did you need to get clearance and they said no it's not a medical piece of their product yeah.

283
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:09,840
So I said maybe like I understand that adhesive patches so great for physical activity especially when you're running like that thing is not going anywhere.

284
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:24,840
This one your pump will probably fall off but there are so many different you know aspects of our lives that maybe you know one time I want to wear this maybe when if I'm running American I'll wear the other one first maybe they can have a few different options of adhesive patches.

285
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:37,840
Today's episode is sponsored by T one D exchange you can directly make an impact on diabetes health care treatments and technology by participating in the T one D exchange registry.

286
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:57,840
It starts with the simple survey about your life with T one D and it only takes about 15 minutes after that you'll have a personal portal with ongoing T one D study and survey opportunities plus some of these studies even offer compensation signing up with the link in the show notes help support my channel and it allows me to continue putting out free content.

287
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:05,840
You can sign up at t one D exchange dot org slash diabetic or click that link in today's show notes.

288
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,840
Let's get back to colito a couple things that they told me was the new pump has an accelerometer in it.

289
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:19,840
Oh, okay. What do you think of that that is cool I mean potentially you could use that for like algorithm stuff like if you're if it notices physical activity.

290
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
Not as pretty cool.

291
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:34,840
Yeah, that was that was a surprise they said that what they're doing is whether or not it's used on launch is in there so that it's this pump can last longer and they can continue to make upgrades to algorithm and things like that and incorporate it.

292
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:54,840
Because yeah, if you're running really fast that accelerometer will pick that up there's also a temperature sensor in there that's cool now the temperature sensor it's not like for your human body to sense what your temperature is and they said that because like people where they're pumping all different areas and you can't really control that but it's really a temperature sensor for the insulin.

293
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,840
Yeah, and to let you know hey your insulin's a little warm.

294
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,840
You need to leave where you are or change your pods soon.

295
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,840
I always wonder if you could like combine those two and like detect when you're sleeping right because like less movement but they're still warm.

296
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,840
Right and then maybe it changes the algorithm in a certain way.

297
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,840
That would be so if you're running and you're really hot.

298
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:23,840
Yeah, yeah, like odds are there's there's impact when you're running in the heat right or your or your body heat that's coming off of your skin.

299
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,840
There's something there so it's exciting to see that they're putting these you know sensors in there.

300
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,840
That is really cool.

301
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
Yeah, I didn't know that.

302
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:39,840
Yeah, a couple other things for colito two was that app control will come on launch for Android and iPhone currently you need a PDM for the device.

303
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
Nice.

304
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
It's running the Diabolube G1 algorithm.

305
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,840
Although the colito two will most likely have the G2 algorithm of that.

306
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,840
And USB-C in the charger, which is probably will definitely because Europe made them.

307
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,840
And as made everyone in Europe have USB-C, which I'm I'm all for.

308
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
Yes.

309
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,840
I'll for it.

310
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,840
Love the iPhone being USB-C.

311
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
That's great.

312
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,840
Yeah, let's talk about this new terminology that's been spoken about at this conference.

313
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,840
So one term we actually talked about it last year on the podcast was Time and Tight Range,

314
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,840
which is also time and pregnancy range.

315
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
Right.

316
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
It's 70 to 140.

317
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,840
Is that?

318
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,840
Yeah. Well, technically pregnancy is 63 to 140.

319
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Time and Tight Range, I've seen it defined differently.

320
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,840
But the most conventional is 70 to 140.

321
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,840
Sometimes I'll see 65 to 140 just to make it on par with pregnancy.

322
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
But yeah.

323
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
Okay.

324
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,840
And that's milligrams per desolator.

325
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,840
Do you know millimals on that?

326
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
No.

327
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
But quick trick.

328
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
You just divided by 18.

329
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
I didn't know that.

330
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
First I had a patient encounter and I was like,

331
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,840
Calculator or like going to Google.

332
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,840
And then later I learned I just had to divide by 18.

333
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,840
Yeah, I learned that this week.

334
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,840
And I mean the easiest way to do it at least my the top of my range is 180.

335
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
So I know 180's at least 10.

336
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,840
Yep.

337
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
And I just used that.

338
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
Because dividing things by 18's not that easy.

339
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
Yeah.

340
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
And then four on the floor.

341
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,840
72 is low blood sugar.

342
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
Okay.

343
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,840
So that's time and tight range.

344
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,840
But there's this new terminology that's being spoken about,

345
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,840
which is 10.

346
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,840
Time in normal glucose.

347
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
Right.

348
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,840
This new terminology was created because there was controversy over time and

349
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,840
tight range being.

350
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,840
To intensive and ask or tell us more about why time and tight range.

351
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
Why people felt like that needed a new name.

352
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,840
Yeah.

353
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,840
So the funny thing is I don't even think the name was the huge issue.

354
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,840
But the concept of it is somewhat controversial.

355
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
Yeah.

356
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,840
Because, you know, I think we talked about this last year.

357
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,840
But the general fear is that basically by moving the yard posts.

358
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,840
Right.

359
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,840
By moving the goal posts and saying like, oh, no.

360
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,840
We're no longer shooting for time and range from 70 to 180.

361
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,840
Now we're actually wanting you to go to 70 to 140.

362
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,840
But we know that with type and diabetes, especially, that's really hard to do.

363
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,840
And we don't want to discourage people.

364
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,840
And we don't want people to feel like they're falling short.

365
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,840
Because we know that the data is very good behind time and range.

366
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,840
And if you maintain that 70% time and range, it really reduces your risk of having complications.

367
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,840
So I think a lot of people, especially those of us who are clinicians or patients or people with diabetes,

368
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:13,840
that are very, you know, protective of kind of the emotional burden and mental state of people with diabetes.

369
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,840
I think we've been very resistant to kind of adopting time and tight range.

370
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,840
Because we don't want people to feel like that's where they need to be.

371
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,840
And that they should really be focusing on 70 and 140.

372
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,840
Now, if you can get there or if you're that type of patient and some people are that type of patient who really,

373
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:34,840
really wants to kind of be on that edge of normal blood or of tight blood trigger control,

374
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,840
it's fine to have that metric.

375
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,840
But the controversy is just how much we want to push that and how much we want to standardize that and make that kind of the goal,

376
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,840
rather than talking about time and range.

377
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,840
And there's a lot of controversy because some people are very excited about it.

378
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,840
Personally, I think a lot of the companies are very excited about it because they want,

379
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,840
they kind of want tighter metrics to be able to prove that their algorithms are better.

380
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,840
And, you know, we're serving people with diabetes better because we have a better time and tight range than other companies.

381
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840
Interesting.

382
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:10,840
So there are some companies we're able to say, wow, we have a really high percentage in this even more so than all these other companies.

383
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,840
Whereas when you're using that larger range, well, it's not as high a bracket and everyone kind of fits it.

384
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,840
Yeah, I think they're just trying to find ways to differentiate and make their system sound better,

385
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,840
which is great. Like we want, of course, the best control we can.

386
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,840
But we also don't want to, you know, set standards that are very difficult to achieve that could be discouraging.

387
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,840
And that's, that's the delicate balance.

388
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,840
So they had a big group meeting here at this conference to kind of talk about it, the pros and cons.

389
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,840
And I guess one of the things that came up was, can they come up with a better name for it?

390
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,840
And the name that they landed on was Ting, which is time in normal glucose or time in normal glycine.

391
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,840
As soon as I heard it, the word normal struck me the wrong way.

392
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,840
I'm the same as you.

393
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,840
Yeah, especially because I feel like when we've tried to come up with terminology in the diabetes space,

394
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,840
I feel like we're so sensitive to, to, to, to verbage and no one glacier that I agree.

395
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:11,840
Like hearing that word normal kind of like, you know, like my, I twitch a little bit because then it implies that if you're not there, you're abnormal, right?

396
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:18,840
Which, which is not the purpose of time and time range. So I think that's like hopefully that name is not the final name.

397
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:25,840
Yeah, so let us know what you think of those two. I'll be putting a poll on Instagram and I want to hear from you.

398
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:33,840
And if you don't like either of those, you'll have to let us know in the comments on here or on Instagram of what you think it should be.

399
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:40,840
Give us some ideas and maybe we can send those over to the powers that be and let them, you know, choose between one of those.

400
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,840
Yeah, maybe if they have a third, better suggestion.

401
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,840
Yeah, or we'll just make it happen. We can make that happen and we will.

402
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,840
Well, that's really everything I had on my list was if you took one thing from this whole week.

403
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,840
What would you say, what was something you were most excited about? It could be big, it could be small.

404
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,840
I mean, I just being the nerd I am, I was just really excited about learning about the 15 day sensor.

405
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:08,840
I think hearing that it has an updated algorithm gives me excitement and just knowing that things are,

406
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:14,840
there are other things coming around the corner. Like, I think this could be an opportunity for Dexcom to really, you know,

407
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,840
make a really strong impression and to kind of write some of the wrongs. You know, the G7 launch was was pretty rocky.

408
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:27,840
I think most of us would agree that is was the case. It sounds like they're actually very being very purposeful about the 15 day launch.

409
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,840
They're going to kind of wait until they have really good supply until it has more pump integrations.

410
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,840
So I think they're going to really try to make sure that the 15 day launch goes smoothly.

411
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,840
And so that's what I'm excited about.

412
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,840
I think I was most excited about twist and it's well,

413
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,840
Libra III because I would love to use a pump with Libra III. I've never done that before,

414
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:57,840
but also the pharmacy benefit manager ability to get that pump so easily and just try it four a month, try it for three months

415
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,840
and then not be held to it. My goal this year is to try every insulin pump available in the U.S.

416
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:10,840
That's awesome. I've tried OmniPot Dash, Loop, Trio, OmniPot V, MonMovie right now,

417
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,840
which you could just say I use tandem T-Slim kind. I mean, it's the same algorithm,

418
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,840
so I'm not rushing to use that one, but I want to use twist. I want to use metronic beta bionics.

419
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:26,840
That's my goal this year and hearing from twist that that is a possibility. So simple.

420
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,840
I mean, we know insurance companies is not always that simple, but I will let you know how simple it is,

421
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:40,840
but that's that excited to me. I mean, this is an awesome pump with a cool algorithm that that's from the open source community originally and we call to use it.

422
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,840
Yeah, and just hearing you lay out all those different pumps. I think it's so exciting, right? Like even just three years ago,

423
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,840
it was like X2, metronic and OmniPot, right? But now we have beta bionics. Now we have the sequel twist.

424
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:58,840
We have Moby, we have Potentially Colito, and all these different things we have, and we have more sensors before it was just DexComb versus metronic.

425
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Now we have Sensionics. Now we have Sensionics ever since. Now we have Libre, it's really exciting and we get so excited about interoperability.

426
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:13,840
You guys deserve to have a choice in your algorithm. You choose your pump. You choose your sensor and I think we're slowly getting there.

427
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:22,840
And it's really exciting. It is slow. It is a slow process. And I always say I chose the wrong industry to be an influencer.

428
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:31,840
There's also so much red tape, but I think going to these conferences every year, quarterly, we at least get to see the progress.

429
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,840
The micro-progress that means a lot. So I'm glad that we could do this here, David. Thank you so much.

430
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:44,840
We want to hear what is the technology or anything that you heard about ATTD. What are you most excited about?

431
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,840
Let us know in the comments and also subscribe to the podcast wherever you listen or on YouTube for video form.

432
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,840
I'm Justin, this is David, and we'll take you later.
