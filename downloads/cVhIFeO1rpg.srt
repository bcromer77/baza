00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,960
Hey guys, welcome to my E-Bags Professional Slim laptop backpack review and unpacking.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,440
Today I'm going to tell you all about the backpack, why I love it, and I'll show you

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,400
what I have packed in it for every shoot or vacation.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,400
Cheers!

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,640
Also, don't worry, I've placed links for the backpack and all other products I bring

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,840

Alright, here we go.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:37,080
Meet the E-Bags Professional Slim laptop backpack.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,920
The backpack is full of innovative and organized compartments, allowing all of my gear

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,360
to have its own place, and it's extremely versatile.

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,120
I can plop it onto my suitcase and roll it around, I can un-latch the straps and tuck them

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,720
in to carry it like a briefcase, oh, yeah, I can also wear it like a backpack.

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,280
I've had this backpack for months now, and I've taken it all over Europe on weekend trips,

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,800
video shoots, and of course, those basic economy flights.

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,680
I can say with absolute certainty that this is the perfect technology and content creator backpack.

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,600
The backpack's listed for 140, but there is always a discount code right on the website that allows

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,240
you to get it for 69, 99, and let me tell you, it is worth every penny.

20
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,160
It comes in a few different colors, I love the Olive Green one I chose.

21
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,600
There's a smaller version called the Junior Laptop backpack that goes for the same price.

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,920
The reason I got this is because it was recommended to me by someone who was recommended to,

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,240
by someone else who was recommended to, by someone else.

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,000
Basically, this came highly recommended, so I had to get it because as a producer and video editor,

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,200
I was looking for a backpack that I could hold all of my technology that I'm going to take

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,720
for video editing and shooting for some weekend trips, or just like a really heavy shoot.

27
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,440
Now, I'll unpack it and show you what I've gotten inside.

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,480
First, I'll show you this cool little compartment down here.

29
00:01:53,480 --> 00:02:00,000
So this has my charging from iPad, my computer charger, and it also has the DJI Osmo Pocket.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,280
This is a camera that I take everywhere with me, and it's a three-axis stabilizer, it's by DJI.

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,560
When I go like this, it's going to stabilize.

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,440
It shoots in 4K, slow-mo, and has facial tracking.

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,560
This is a really great piece of gear to take on the go for shooting.

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,680
So what's really cool is this whole thing comes out here.

35
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,880
So if you really want to cram this tight, and then lock it up with this zipper, that,

36
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,440
then you put it right back in, love it.

37
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,200
The front is where I put my notebook, some business cards, yep, that's me on the business card.

38
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,320
I also put stevia's in here.

39
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,960
Stevia's are very important for anyone to have, and I actually take some of these from Cockishops

40
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,800
here and they call them my steleas.

41
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,400
America runs on Duncan, but just in tech runs on stevia, let me tell you.

42
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,400
Now my favorite compartment right here, check out all this organization.

43
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,920
So I have OCD, like a tiny bit, and this helps me out here.

44
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,080
I've got an external battery charger, then a mouse, but I like to have a mouse when I'm editing.

45
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,680
In here, I have my go-to-

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:10,880
It's my iPad, but it's Toby, let me guess it's Toby.

47
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,400
Hi, what do you want on filming?

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Say hi.

49
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
Hi.

50
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Hi.

51
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Hi.

52
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
What do you want?

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Hey guys, look, look, look for the first time in forever.

54
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,360
So right here, actually, while we're filming, this is our home that we are completely renovating

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,400
and throwing in all the coolest smart home gear, stay tuned for that series, really excited

56
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
about it.

57
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
We have a blue door now.

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
And we've got a blue door.

59
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Yeah, it's blue door.

60
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Love it.

61
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Okay, Toby, so we're going to go because we have to film.

62
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Okay, bye.

63
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Okay, and right there, not going to tell you what that is, but right there, that's a bookcase.

64
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
You did tell us what it is.

65
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Or at least that's what you're thinking is.

66
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Okay, so back to the shoot.

67
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
And right here, we have my go-to SSD for editing.

68
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,400
This Sandisk Solid State Drive is amazing.

69
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,400
It has a read right of 550 megabits per second, and it is such a portable and efficient editing

70
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
hard drive.

71
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,400
It's also shock absorbin and water and dust resistant.

72
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,399
Then right here, I have another gadget that I love, which is basically an adapter for MacBook Pro,

73
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,399
and it gives me all of the different ports I need.

74
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,400
And then, of course, my AirPods Pro, I came out with a review recently, and if you haven't seen that yet,

75
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,400
you can click that link right up there that I just threw there.

76
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Highly recommend these, and I've got a lot to say about them.

77
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
So check that out if you want.

78
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,400
So, yeah, lots in this front compartment, and I love how organized it is.

79
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Oh, my god, it's so organized.

80
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,400
So, yeah, I mean, my therapist tells me I shouldn't compartmentalize my feelings,

81
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
but, you know what, I can compartmentalize my tech all I want with this thing.

82
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
He said it's okay.

83
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Back here, we've got an opening, and that's where you put your laptop right there.

84
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Perfect.

85
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
You must be wondering, what is all this?

86
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,400
Well, I'm going to show you.

87
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Right in here, this is where I put a pair of clothing for my weekend trip,

88
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
and then also my Nintendo Switch.

89
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,400
If I'm not going on a weekend trip, I'll actually put the camera that's being used right now.

90
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,400
In here, this will fit perfectly in here, and then I'm literally ready for a shoot.

91
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Another cool thing, while I'm here, I'm a little dehydrated.

92
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,400
I'm going to put this water bottle right there.

93
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
You'll never go thirsty with this backpack.

94
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
I swear.

95
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Unless you don't refill.

96
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
And then, oh my god, I forgot.

97
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Right here, there's another slot.

98
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
You know what's in there?

99
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,400
My iPad, and it also has a keyboard case on it,

100
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,400
and I also just reviewed this case as well.

101
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Plug right there if you want to check it out.

102
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
So there you guys have it.

103
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,400
That is my e-bag's professional slim laptop backpack review.

104
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
I'm Justin, and I'll pack you later.

105
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Cheers.

106
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
It's a really old water.
