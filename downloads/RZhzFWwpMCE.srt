00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Holy crap! Apple's worldwide developer conference just ended and I am stunned. So much was said,

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,800
but here are the top 10 things you need to know.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:20,000
First thing is Apple announced a new show called for all mankind on their Apple TV plus platform.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,880
It's from the creators of Star Trek and Battlestar Galactica and it's a show that imagines a world

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,040
where the Soviets are the first to land on the moon. It's basically about the space race and

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,680
a push to get to Mars. This show looks really awesome with a very large budget.

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,879
Also Tim Cook said he saw an early sneak peek of the entire first season and he loves it. So

8
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,960
why wouldn't we? Next up is Watch OS. There is now an app store right on your wrist. So

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,280
you can download and install apps right on the watch. Next up is iOS 13 a few things here.

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,080
Just like the last Mac update we are now getting a dark mode for iOS and it looks

11
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,360
Also the photos app is getting a much needed facelift. Your phone always has all these pictures

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,120
because you took 15 of them. It now condenses them to show you days, months and years and it's really

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:13,520
really pretty. Okay this one has me ridiculously excited and it's AirPods audio sharing. So what that

14
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,960
means is if you have AirPods and a friend has AirPods and maybe a few other ones you can all be listening

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,920
to the same thing at the same time. This is something I've like fantasized about since college.

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,240
Now you can like go on a stroll with all your friends with AirPods and not even talk to each other

17
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,480
and just listen to the same music. Also really excited about this one. I think I'm just excited about

18
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,080
everything. It's CarPlay multitasking. I've been waiting for this and it's finally here. You can now have

19
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:45,200
split screen on CarPlay and Siri won't take up the whole screen when you talk to him or her. Can't wait for it.

20
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:53,120
Okay this one is big Apple announced iPad OS today. Yeah so what that means is the iPad is officially

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:00,880
breaking apart from the iPhone and it's becoming its own thing. iPad OS is widget a f. This new

22
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,040
OS is going to have amazing multitasking. You're going to have notes next to notes. You can have

23
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,440
word documents next to word documents. You can take pictures and put them in other things and you can

24
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,840
now plug in flash drives. All right Apple, thanks for the flash drive support but why don't we move to

25
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,280
USB-C instead this lightning cable thing okay and what Apple basically did today was say hey listen we're

26
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,960
going to make your iPad a Mac without making it a Mac so you'll need a Mac. Why? Because many we want

27
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,320
you to have an iPad and a Mac. Hashtag Apple but I'm kind of okay with it and I kind of want to

28
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:39,280
iPad now. I don't have one. Okay so this one came out of left field for me. A Mac pro was announced today

29
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,640
or should I say a cheese grater. So Apple is going back to their roots of being able to customize things.

30
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:54,320
Yay finally we can customize our Mac pros. This thing is a powerful freaking beast. I'm not going

31
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,920
to get into the nitty gritty of this thing. Let's just say it's freaking powerful. This thing starts at

32
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,400
$6,000 and this is what you're getting for that. Which brings me to my next one. This is the brand new

33
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:14,240
display by Apple called the Pro Display XDR and it is beautiful. This thing is super powerful. It is a 6k

34
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:20,400
retina display. I also really appreciate that super audible throne as the Apple was like oh by the

35
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,680
way this screen doesn't actually come with a stand you have to pay for that. This starts at $5,000 and

36
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,240
I don't got no money from Apple. Help me I'm poor. Next is Mac OS Catalina which I've actually never

37
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:38,160
been to and I really want to go. So you have me tips let me know. Anyway not a ton here but basically we

38
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,920
are going to get some revamp apps. There's new reminders and new notes and that new photos app.

39
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,480
One thing that's really great with the new Mac OS is voice control. So they're making a huge emphasis on

40
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,079
being able to talk to your Mac and this actually works across all the OS's. People will now be able to

41
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:01,600
speak to their devices using numbers or being like do you correct that for me? This is really amazing and

42
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,519
I think this is a really good push for accessibility. Also at this time we are finally saying goodbye

43
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,720
to iTunes. After 18 years iTunes is officially dead and it's being replaced by three apps a podcast

44
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,640
app and Apple TV app and an Apple music app. Don't ask me why we couldn't just do this in one app and

45
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,320
have three different sections. They decided to make three apps. Let's take a moment of silence to

46
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:34,320
remember iTunes. And lastly this is something that's got me really excited for the future and it is

47
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:41,440
AR augmented reality on iOS. A couple of people from Minecraft came on stage and they showed us how

48
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,440
AR is going to work and it is fascinating. They were able to not only play with two devices and see

49
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,840
each other interacting in the game but they were able to inject themselves in the game. And this is

50
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,680
really just the beginning and it's not something we're really going to be doing who wants to really

51
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,159
hold an iPad and do AR. No Apple is going to eventually come out with some glasses that you put on

52
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,160
and that's how you interact in the AR world. We're not there yet but that's the future implications of this

53
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,160
and I'm ready for it. So those are my top 10 takeaways just some little snippets but I had to let you know

54
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,120
what's going on in the Apple world because my mind is blown. As Apple releases some of these

55
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,160
data I will be covering knows as well so definitely subscribe to my channel for more of those videos and

56
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:34,000
follow me on the social media. Other than that I'm Justin I'll take you later.

57
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,040
Did I do that?
