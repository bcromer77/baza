1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
I have been wearing the tandem moby insulin pump for about three months now.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,160
It is the smallest hybrid closed loop tube pump in the US.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,880
I mean, look at it. It is a tiny little thing.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,000
Today, I wanted to dive deeper into its algorithm, my favorite features about it,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,280
and some tips and tricks with it, and talk about what my transition from

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,160
tubeless to tube has been like.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,160
Welcome to Diabetic. I'm just an eye of type one diabetes, and on here, I talk all things

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,600
diabetes, tech, news, and research. Today, I'm joined by diabetes educator, David Mina,

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,680
who lives with type one himself and uses the tandem moby. He helps train patients on a wide range

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,440
of insulin pumps, including the moby. We get into why he became a diabetes educator,

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,519
his experience with different pumps over the years, and why he chooses to still use tandem.

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,720
We also break down the tandem algorithm, how it works, the updates with control like you

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:04,640
plus, and what people should know before switching. I share my take on what the transition from

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,320
an omnipod tubeless pump to a tube pump. What that was like, it's been quite challenging,

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:18,560
as well as my love for the moby-quick-bullet button. This thing is so much fun to use, and then we

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,200
also get into some excitement. We have over the twist insulin pump that is coming very soon.

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,920
This is just the beginning for my moby content. There's already a site change video up on YouTube.

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,680
I've got an app walkthrough video coming up, as well as a video where I dive deeper into my transition

19
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,960
from tubeless to tube. I'm going back to tube, and then also a review of the tandem moby that

20
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,440
will be coming soon. So, make sure you subscribe to my YouTube channel so you get updated as soon as

21
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:51,360
that releases. Keep in mind that all of my episodes are not medical advice and are educational

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,039
Let's get into it. Dave, welcome to the show. Good to have you here. How's it going?

24
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:04,560
Good to tell me. I'm good. I'm good. I'm very excited to be here.

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,800
Yeah, you work at the same office as David on, right? I do. I do. How well do you know him?

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,480
Pretty well. I've been working with him for about two years now, and we've been

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,959
good friends also before then. So, okay. Pretty comfortable. Very, very cool working with him,

28
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,959
learning a lot from him daily. So, that's great. Yeah, he's a crowd-favored on this show. I love having him

29
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,160
on whenever there's a conference him, and I will get together and talk about what we saw there and

30
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,799
geek out. It's always fun talking to him. But more about you, you were diagnosed at 11 years old.

31
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:50,960
Yes. And now you are a certified diabetes educator. Tell me about what inspired you to choose that

32
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:57,600
line of work. Well, I, like he said, was diagnosed at 11. So, I was in the sixth grade. Very new

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:05,920
concept to me. Did I know anybody in my life personally living with diabetes at all, but let alone type one.

34
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,880
So, it was very new to me. Very shocking, obviously, to me and my family. And just learning that

35
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:21,600
news at first. So, I think my experience being introduced to diabetes, I will say, did not start off on the

36
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:29,920
best. But I was very confused, very scared. Why is this happening to me? You know, you're 11. You want to just

37
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,360
be a normal kid. Be with your friends. Go, you know, to school. Do all of those things. And now I

38
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:42,640
had to relearn. I feel I had to relearn life in a way and how to incorporate diabetes into my life. So,

39
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,720
you know, I will say I went through a couple of burnout periods throughout my first couple of years with diabetes.

40
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:59,360
Had the highest A1c, I had ever hit maybe about two or three years afterwards. And there was a

41
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,560
point when I went to my endocrinologist for my three-month appointment. And my diabetes educator,

42
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:15,200
actually, is the one who came in and pretty much gave me this fear factor lecture telling me, you know,

43
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,680
if you don't get a grip on your diabetes, you're going to have X amount of complications later on in life.

44
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:30,880
And that really impacted me. It made me want to change my habits. You know, I was going for long periods

45
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,280
of time where I would be afraid to take insulin at school because I was afraid of going low. Very,

46
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,400
you know, embarrassed back then that I had this thing called diabetes that no other kid at my

47
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:51,040
school had. And so that is a lot where the behavioral elements came from and from that moment,

48
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,600
right after that appointment, I changed my ways. I said, I'm going to move forward on a positive note

49
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,400
and I'm going to take control over this thing. So, that was a very pivotal moment in my whole journey with

50
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:12,000
diabetes that really spoke to me and made me want to do something not only for myself, but for others.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,200
I think that experience that my educator and I shared where it was not the most positive experience.

52
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:26,240
It taught me that I wanted to be that person to somebody, but handle it in a different way, essentially.

53
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:34,880
I want to go into a room with a patient and give them proper education and allow them to feel that they know

54
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,800
they have the resources available to them and here's how we can get to that point together.

55
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,440
I never want somebody to feel that they have to manage this disease alone. So,

56
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,400
that was a very, like I said, pivotal moment in my life that really spoke to me and made me want to

57
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,640
do something more with my diabetes. Yeah, that's so cool to hear. I mean, my diabetes educator has been

58
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:04,160
one of the most pivotal people in my care and I always tell people when they come to me and they're

59
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,480
having problems or they feel really lost. I'm like, get a diabetes educator, go find one. They

60
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,120
are your, what mindset to me was she was like, I'm your diabetes therapist. You can come in,

61
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,720
you can talk about whatever you want. It's all related to diabetes. It's all going to be in some way,

62
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:28,320
you know, that struggle, that whatever it is, that stress. It's all connected and she's made me,

63
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:35,920
you know, the the carb counter I am and I'm so grateful for her and I'm grateful for people like you,

64
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,680
that that help other people too. And I try to offer my own education too when it comes to at least

65
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,960
the technology that's available and then they can go over to you and then, you know, learn how to use it and

66
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,320
ask about it. You help people get on an on all pumps, right? Or a lot of different parts.

67
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,440
Pretty much yes. Like I always say I like to meet patients where they're act. So, you know,

68
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,120
at the point where they come see me, they've already made the decision. They want to start insulin

69
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:10,240
pump therapy and so depending on which device they choose, it can be, you know, just using

70
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,400
CGM. It could be using pump therapy with CGM. You name it. There are a lot of great options out there

71
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,960
these days. So, we usually just let them choose and then, you know, I'm able to train them on the device

72
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:30,800
that they choose and I really want to instill confidence in them that they know they can use these devices

73
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,280
in their own lifestyle. You have to choose a device that fits your lifestyle. So, yeah, that's

74
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:44,320
usually how it goes when we, when we have a training. Yeah. And I'm sure you've heard of the new twist

75
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,440
pump coming out. Have you been trained on that yet? Are there plans to get trained? Like it is happening?

76
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,520
I just went to Manchester, New Hampshire and I saw them in the production line being built. It was

77
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,560
so cool. Dean came in the inventor of the pump and the original, like the first wearable pump ever.

78
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:06,880
He took me on a tour, which was like so cool. But I'm excited for this. What are your thoughts?

79
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:13,680
Yeah. I actually have been having conversations with our reps here locally and so it's been really

80
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:21,599
exciting learning about the technology. Very, very interested in how it's going to work. As

81
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:28,080
come to therapy, compared to the options we have nowadays, I think each device coming out nowadays

82
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,320
is just getting better and better. A lot of features that I feel the diabetes community has been

83
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:41,440
voicing what they want out of a system. And I think I'm seeing a lot of that being placed into these new

84
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,760
devices such as the twist pump. So, yeah, very excited in the process of getting certified to train on

85
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,960
those, but we haven't fully started training yet. So, you know, more to come on that, but very excited

86
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:02,240
and always, always ready to learn more about all the systems. Yeah, they all have their pros and cons.

87
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:09,760
And I've experienced that firsthand after wearing Omni pod for the last three years using both Omni

88
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:17,040
pod five, the FDA cleared platform, and then using DIY systems. I've been able to experience

89
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,040
all those, and then switching over to Tantamobi for a few months, which inspired this conversation,

90
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,560
and I want to get as much information as I can out of you of, you know, the ways you're using it,

91
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:35,439
the way you speak to patients about it, because there are so many factors of the Mobi that I found to be

92
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:42,800
really beneficial, but I've also had moments with it where I struggle or I'm frustrated about whether

93
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,440
it'd be lifestyle experiences with it, but also just like understanding the platform or getting it to

94
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,040
work the way I want to. And I've worked with my educator, but I don't know, there's just, there's just been

95
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:02,320
a lot of like back and forth of how I feel about it. But before we get into Tantamobi, I want to get an

96
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:11,520
understanding of some of the pumps that you've used leading up to Tantamobi. So I, like we said at the

97
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:18,720
beginning, I've been living with diabetes since the age of 11, so it's been about 16 years now. I went my

98
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:26,400
first year with diabetes doing completely, you know, MDI. And then after that, I started in my first

99
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:34,480
insulin pump way back when it was a metronic pump one of the very first models available. I did that

100
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:41,840
for a few years, and then I switched over to the animus vibe no longer available, but that was a great pump.

101
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:49,280
I really enjoyed it. I hear people love that. It was very, very, I feel user-friendly as a good word to say.

102
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,079
Did you use the Cleo infusion set with that?

103
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,720
Ooh. I don't remember. Yeah, it's far back. They were very similar infusion sets. I think back then

104
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,760
I was still using steel cannula as I remember. So a little bit different, but yeah, I did the animus

105
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:14,480
divides for some time. That was when CGM was starting to become a thing too. So we started seeing that

106
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,000
integrated into the insulin pump. It wasn't, you know, a closed loop system or anything, but

107
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,720
but it was nice, as you could see your decks come, readings on your pump when you would go

108
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:34,080
initiatable as it would automatically populate. So I felt it helped a lot just having two devices in one,

109
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:40,480
essentially. And then I switched over to once my warranty ended with that, and I found out

110
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:48,560
animus V was no longer, I switched over to tandem T-slim. Did that for a few years, and then as

111
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,400
it recently, within the past year, switched to the movie. So that has been my, you know, journey with

112
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,080
insulin pump therapy. So I've been on a pump for about 15 years total, and I'm sure we'll talk about this

113
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:06,880
more within our conversation. But it's been, you know, a lot of learning, but I find that each system,

114
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,800
I switched over to, it's only getting better and better with the technology and the progression we're

115
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,880
seeing in pump therapy, all the features that are being incorporated into these systems are just making things

116
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,240
so much easier to live with diabetes. And it's something, obviously, you and I are both, I'm sure

117
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:31,520
very, very grateful for to have because it does provide a sense of luxury in a way to live with diabetes.

118
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:37,439
And that's something I'm fully aware of and grateful to have. Yeah, I feel so fortunate to have an

119
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:44,720
automated system. And fortunate to have been diagnosed at a time where that was ready for me. I mean,

120
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,640
at least in the DIY space, it was maybe a year after my diagnosis that cleared FDA cleared system,

121
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,760
started having loop or closed loop systems. But I didn't have to go through the years that you did

122
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:03,760
of not knowing or not having the CGM levels connected to a pump. And I don't want, I don't want to

123
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,640
have imagined that. So I'm grateful for that. You know, you had this big decision when T-slims contract

124
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:18,800
went up, you moved over to Moby. Why do you decide to stay in that control-like ecosystem?

125
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,200
Like I said, I always tell patients, you have to find a system that works well in your lifestyle.

126
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:32,560
So when I applied that to my own like the diabetes, I found that the Moby made sense to me,

127
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,760
and especially having that same algorithm that I'm so used to with the T-slim,

128
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,560
you know, I've been on the T-slim for about four or five years. And so when, you know, it came

129
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:52,800
time to switch over to the Moby, I felt like I've had a good grasp on my diabetes in a sense with

130
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,320
having control like you. I found the control like you element helped me live my lifestyle.

131
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:08,080
You know, I'm a busy person. I'm out of the house for 12, 13 hours at day at times. And so it's just

132
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:14,800
a lot of go-go-go, where I find I need a system that I find can be essentially like an assistant or a

133
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,800
sidekick to me in managing my diabetes. And I find control like you is very helpful for that. It has

134
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:29,440
a lot of features in the system that I find I use often to help me optimize the system,

135
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,920
manage my diabetes and achieve the goals that I have for myself. So, you know, that can come from

136
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,960
temp bezels, that can come from, you know, this system deciding to decrease or increase my basil rates

137
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:50,560
to prevent moments where I would normally pause and have to treat my diabetes. So, have you ever

138
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:58,000
thought about just trying out omnipod for a short amount of time? I mean, it's pharmacy benefits.

139
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It doesn't necessarily affect your contract with Moby. Have you ever considered or have you tried on a

140
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,880
tubeless pump for a month or two just to see what that experience is? Yeah, great question. I actually,

141
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:20,320
that is one of the few pumps I have not tried yet. I remember before I switched over to my T-slim pump,

142
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:29,360
it was between the T-slim and the omnipod. And, you know, back then, I remember the plan that I had

143
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,360
my insurance plan could only cover the T-slim. So, that's why I moved forward with that. But, you know,

144
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,760
I'm glad I made that decision, obviously. But, there was a period of time where I was wanting

145
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:50,160
fully tubeless pump therapy and having that freedom where I'm not connected to a device or a tubing.

146
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:58,560
But then, you know, part of my decision was I realized I've been on a pump for at this point now 15

147
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,240
years and they've only ever been two pumps. So, that's all I really know. I'm very comfortable with it.

148
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,600
And then now kind of having the Moby where you could do make it a patch pump if you wanted or you could

149
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,160
wear it as a tube to pump. It gives me that option. So, yes, I've been very interested to try omnipod.

150
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,839
Just as, you know, experience just to see how it works fully and, you know, compare the two with

151
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:32,000
their algorithms. But, I think both are great options. And, I do love that it is a pharmacy benefit too.

152
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,920
So, it is more accessible. I had an interesting experience switching from omnipod to Moby for this

153
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:47,120
little experiment. And, I wasn't ready for this. Like, I didn't realize it would challenge me this

154
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:55,920
much. But, you know, I've been so spoiled by this by omnipod being just like kind of on me and going through

155
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:05,120
my everyday routine, not even thinking about it being on me, really forgetting it's there. And then,

156
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:13,760
starting a tube pump when I go to shower needing to not only detach it from it, but also go

157
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,280
find my phone so that I can stop insulin delivery. So, every time I'm going to shower, I have to go find my

158
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,400
phone, which is, you know, nothing, something I didn't have to do. Going and sitting on the toilet and then

159
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:33,440
either pulling my clipped pump and like, it almost like hurting, you know, like a little bit or it

160
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:40,240
dropping to the ground and like needing to catch it, just like this dangling thing coming off of me or like the

161
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,720
worst, somehow like when I'm switching outfits or like coming out of the shower and I guess I put the two back

162
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,840
on getting dressed and like using one hand to hold my shorts and on my other hand to hold the bump.

163
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:01,920
I'm like, oh my goodness, like that was a big adjustment for me in that realm. And then the other

164
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:07,760
thing that was a bit of an adjustment for me is, you know, I just lived on an island off of Brazil,

165
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:16,960
Florianapolis, beautiful place and I was wearing Speedo a lot and having this like tube coming out

166
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:25,680
or wearing this little sack that little adhesive pouch with my Speedo just didn't feel and I hate

167
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:33,760
that I felt this way. I hate it, but it's true like I just didn't feel as confident in the way I

168
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:41,120
looked with it and and I hate that and I hate that I say that because I am a confident person. I'm proud of

169
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:48,000
who I am in my diabetes but it was just a really interesting situation that I found myself in and I actually

170
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,120
documented all these feelings and experiences in a YouTube video that is probably coming out I think at the

171
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:04,400
end of the week that this airs so stay tuned everyone but that was my experience with that shift and

172
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,400
I don't know I just thought I'd bring that up because these are just things I never had to experience before

173
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:18,400
but it just resonated with me that like some insecurities came out for me. Absolutely and thank you

174
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,640
for sharing that because I think that is a very real point that maybe a lot of people experience with

175
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,840
diabetes and maybe don't feel like sharing and I think that is something that we have to incorporate

176
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:38,400
into the decisions we make for how we manage our diabetes so I know a lot of people unfortunately may not

177
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:45,600
want to wear a pump or a CGM for reasons like that and by all means I mean I always say again it has to

178
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,960
work for your lifestyle so as long as you're obviously not neglecting your diabetes care you're still

179
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,280
taking injections or checking your blood sugar manually whatever works for you but I think there are ways

180
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:03,680
and there are you know transition periods where you switch over for example from one insulin pump to another

181
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:10,160
where you might experience a moment like you did you know at the beach or something and it's the first time

182
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:16,160
you're faced with that reality where it's very new to you it's a new device it's a new environment and

183
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,640
you're just now having to essentially relearn how am I going to live my life with this new device

184
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,800
and doesn't make sense for me or not so these are all valid feelings and all very important things to

185
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:34,800
consider I think by you sharing that especially is going to help a lot of people because you know they won't

186
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:41,200
feel alone I mean I felt similar to that before just kind of in my everyday life like I totally

187
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,680
understand when you're changing when you're showering things like that you have to know

188
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:51,440
disciple where is this pump gonna go and how am I going to operate it in these moments that a lot of

189
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:59,040
people wouldn't think about so very very real moment yeah I feel like in those moments of using the toilet

190
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:06,400
showering swimming whatever it was it was a reminder like a poke saying you have diabetes you have

191
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:15,520
diabetes and I don't experience that as much with the the tubeless factor and and and the good

192
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,720
good news is for people who feel that way too a lot of these companies including tandem are all

193
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,680
working on a tubeless pump so soon we're going to have so many options and I'm sure there will still be

194
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:32,400
people out there that prefer to I'm actually I'm wearing my movie probably for like the last the last day

195
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,720
I could I was gonna like take it off yesterday and put on my omnipot before I returned it but I was like well I

196
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:44,080
should wear it for the amp you so I've got my movie on and I'm returning it so they had the 90 day return ball

197
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,960
Sam returning it this week but I'm so grateful that I got to use I mean this thing is small it is a tiny little

198
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,280
this is the smallest two pump a half the size maybe even more than half the size of T slim and then

199
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,360
way smaller than metronics 70 dg I think my favorite feature on this pump has got to be the

200
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:12,639
ballas button I am obsessed with this thing like and I'll tell I used it yesterday at the Delta lounge

201
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:21,600
I'm you know I left my phone by my computer and I'm going to to get some snacks at the buffet and I'm like

202
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:29,200
shoot I don't have my phone I'm like wait a second I don't need my phone a ballast right now and I just hold down on it and it goes here

203
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:37,680
I'll even I just hold down on it and it goes like Baba and then I go like one two three you could do up to three one two or three

204
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,240
I'm not gonna confirm it and so what I would do is I would confirm that and right there that would have been 45 grams of

205
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:52,080
carbs logging into it you could do you know you can program it a bunch of different ways so that was it saying you didn't

206
00:22:52,800 --> 00:23:00,480
you know dose which is good because otherwise I'd be low in 20 minutes but that that is hands down the coolest

207
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,960
feature for me especially coming from the tubeless pump where Omni pod doesn't have any type of onboard

208
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,880
controls to bolus you need to go get your phone in order to bolus so

209
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,160
you really could just you know be without your phone for a while have the alerts from your pump if you go low

210
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,280
use that for eating and then your dex calm or your CGM you're using could be connected to your watch I mean you

211
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:33,680
really could be pretty mobile from your phone and I like to not use my phone what would you say is your favorite

212
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:40,080
feature of moby you know I think going back to that where to use the personal system or

213
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:50,240
psychic I just find that you know every device I've used to manage my diabetes I just adapt to that device and so

214
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:57,840
now I know anytime I need to make treatment decisions specific to my pump it's all on my phone so I really love

215
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:04,320
having that option I think my favorite feature is simply mobile voicing you know looking back to when

216
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:11,439
I was newly diagnosed and we didn't even have yes there was technology but I wasn't at least using it right

217
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:19,280
away the concept of being able to deliver a bolus from my phone at the age of 11 would have been beyond me I mean

218
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:26,240
I think that was the coolest thing and I remember when I started on the tandem T-slimp pump there was

219
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:33,440
no mobile bullets just yet and I remember when that update came out I was super super excited because

220
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:40,560
again that concept is just very freeing to know you don't have to always pull out your device and deliver a

221
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:47,920
bolus if you're for example in a meeting or you're you know in a situation where you can't always pull out your

222
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:55,120
device or maybe you don't want to you have that option you can very very discreetly look at your texting

223
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,280
almost and you're really delivering a bolus I say like you're texting your pincreate essentially and so

224
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:08,560
just kind of allowing that flow of insulin to go through and very seamlessly is very exciting

225
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:17,040
this episode is sponsored by OmniPod as someone with T1D and with an incredibly active lifestyle it's

226
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:23,040
important for me not to get tied up especially with tubes on my insulin pump I love to go swimming,

227
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,720
lift weights and play kickball with friends and with OmniPod 5 I never have to worry about tubes

228
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,159
getting in the way plus not having to disconnect helps me to stay in range during all of my favorite

229
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:40,159
physical activities that includes sexy time too see if you're eligible for a 30 day trial by visiting

230
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,920
OmniPod.com slash dive tech on there you'll see full safety and risk information and trial terms

231
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:53,760
that's OmniPod.com slash dive tech first can you kind of explain to us with control like you

232
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:01,360
how what that algorithm is doing absolutely so just like it says control like you it's trying to keep you

233
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:08,880
within a type control and so you know there's this graph I love going over with my new pump starts

234
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,280
because it really simplifies the whole concept those control like you essentially it'll show the

235
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:22,800
diagram of those colored diamonds that you see on your screen and then you know different functions what

236
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:30,080
may be taking place if you see it happen on your dashboard so usually I like to go over you know the pump

237
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,240
is trying to keep you in this maintenance mode is what I call it and it goes to keep your glucose

238
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:45,680
between a 112.5 and a 160 range yeah you're target glucose on the tandem is 110 but within that

239
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:52,480
112.5 and 160 range you're you're good essentially you know and it's trying to keep you within that box

240
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:59,280
anything above or below it's going to adjust accordingly and try to prevent a high or a low

241
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:06,160
blood sugar one thing I always want to stress with my patients is don't think that once you start an

242
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:12,080
insulin pump your high and low blood sugars will go away you'll still have them but control like you

243
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:20,480
is trying to limit that and reduce it as much as possible so anything above that 160 threshold if it's

244
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:27,040
predicted to go above 160 and 30 minutes it gives you an increase in your basil rates and then anything

245
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:33,840
predicted above 180 it'll give you that more aggressive auto correction bullets on the flip side

246
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:41,360
if it's predicted to go below the 112.5 it's going to decrease your basil rate and below 70 and 30 minutes

247
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:47,920
it's going to suspend all insulin delivery until your glucose goes back up so I really love that it has

248
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:55,920
that type control for you and then you know once you go into you know tighter features for example

249
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:02,080
there's that sleep activity and there's the exercise activity those are what I like to call safety

250
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:08,960
nuts in those particular situations when you're sleeping it's trying to keep you in a tighter range of

251
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:19,520
112.5 and 120 and then while you're exercising 140 to 160 so very careful in those situations it's

252
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:27,040
trying to make sure you're safe and you're good essentially as we have said several times lifestyle

253
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:32,879
you know we sleep at different times of the day we exercise at different times of the day to having these

254
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:39,840
assistance to help you in those particular situations are very very helpful and it's all trying to increase

255
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,520
your time and range decrease your A1C to that target that you and your doctor may set for yourself.

256
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,120
Yeah I want to get into those modes in just a second but before we get there tell us about the auto

257
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:57,680
corrections so how tandem stands out ahead of some of the competition is it can send out auto

258
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:06,639
boluses in addition to its basil adjustments that will treat they'll do it up to once an hour

259
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:15,040
it will treat with a burst of insulin in order to bring you down. What is it kind of doing there so

260
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,440
when you're for example in the sleep mode it shuts all auto corrections completely and then

261
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:28,720
when you're in the exercise mode it does up to one per hour just to prevent you from having a low

262
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:36,240
well exercising but having those correction boluses sometimes obviously our glucose is rising a bit quicker

263
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:44,080
through our pattern and our trend that the dex calm is displaying it might show we are rising pretty quickly

264
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:50,480
and based on the settings we input into our device is going to give us those correction boluses as

265
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,879
a more aggressive dose versus your basil rate because your basil rate can only go up to a certain amount

266
00:29:56,879 --> 00:30:04,320
based on your max basil rate so you know let's say you're running high for several hours the pump is

267
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:11,199
working super hard to try to bring you down with those increased basil rates but once it hits that max

268
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,840
it's going to you know almost tap out it can't do beyond that so that's where the correction

269
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:24,800
boluses come in and you know with that algorithm it's predicting above 180 and 30 minutes if it continues

270
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:30,880
to notice that pattern it's going to deliver the correction bolus it takes into account you know

271
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:38,880
your insulin board and when is the last time you pull this things like that but it is there to assist

272
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:47,200
beyond those basil rates if needed so one thing I noticed using the moby that kind of scared me was that

273
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:58,240
if I saw that if I was having a low like a minor low around 70 or going low if I was going to eat

274
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:05,360
say 50 grams of carbs I would enter that in and the app would still recommend me taking insulin

275
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:13,040
whereas I felt like when I used not even when I used the Omni-Pod 5 system when I was at that

276
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:20,400
same amount it would not allow me to even if I put in 50 grams of carbs it wouldn't allow me to take

277
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:26,800
insulin for that what's the difference here it scared me when moby was like no you should you should have

278
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:33,360
more insulin I'm like no I'm low yeah I mean it's going to obviously drop the amount of the insulin

279
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,800
you may require because it is seeing that your blood sugar is low and it may be continuing to drop

280
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:45,520
you do have that option to as soon as you go in and type of bolus it will say you're either above or

281
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:53,440
below your target glucose of 110 and if you want that correction obviously you would click yes and it will drop

282
00:31:53,440 --> 00:32:00,160
the amount of insulin if you are low for example I get it there is that fear that maybe you don't want

283
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:05,600
insulin in you while you're going low which by all means obviously you shouldn't but it gives you

284
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:13,200
that option and it just shows that you can take a lower amount of insulin just because of the fact that

285
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:20,160
simply you're low obviously maybe you want to treat a little bit before you initiate a bolus because also

286
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:26,320
when your glucose starts to rise back you'll notice the amount of insulin the pump wants to deliver

287
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:33,360
will now be a little bit more because it sees your glucose is going back up so those are just things

288
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:41,919
to consider obviously you have the option to override the correction or take it if needed but yeah by

289
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:48,080
all means you you have that ability I know on the pipe you're saying would not give you insulin until it

290
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:54,960
senses your glucose going back a tandem it just gives you that option but it's still something that you don't

291
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,600
have to do is just by going to completely shut it down essentially I also noticed that my

292
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:11,360
mobile would send me an alert that I was going low well before my dex calm would and maybe 50% of the

293
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,600
time that mobile be told me I was going to go low I actually didn't okay have you ever noticed that with

294
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,320
your system that mobile is like you're going to go low and then you actually don't wind up going low

295
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,800
and dex calm you know dex calm never alerts you that you are because they're obviously using different

296
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:35,040
algorithms but I just it was interesting like it was just adding another alert that I didn't even want to

297
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:41,040
need it yeah I know you're talking about may think sometimes because you're getting those alerts yes it

298
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:48,000
can be a lot sometimes but mobile is remember able to predict up to 30 minutes into the future so with

299
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,840
those predictions it's trying to alert you and make it seem more intense than maybe it actually

300
00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:01,680
will end up being but with those safety nets it's decreasing basal or it's suspending basal that is when

301
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,960
you may end up just leveling out so yeah there have been times where I would get alerts like that and it

302
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,960
looks like I'm going to have a pretty low blood sugar but then I'll let five ten minutes pass maybe

303
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:20,960
in that process and then see I ended up flattening out and I primarily attribute that to the

304
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:28,800
algorithm not treating with maybe cars because I feel having less insulin going into my system is what

305
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:37,120
is going to help me from crashing and so yes those scenarios do happen but it is nice that you have

306
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:42,880
that second set of eyes essentially through the mobile to give you those alerts but also to prevent

307
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:51,680
insulin yeah I kind of gotten to this a lot before about wearing a two pump of being so new and

308
00:34:51,680 --> 00:35:00,800
in all these areas of my life it being kind of annoying are there any tricks that you use to

309
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:08,960
to hold on to your two pump and in all these areas of life so with the teaspoon because it was a

310
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:17,200
little bit bigger I would just clip it usually on the back my back pocket and then sometimes

311
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,720
depending on what I was wearing at the time it was probably something a little more uncomfortable sorry

312
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,960
more comfortable like sweats I might just clip it to the front of my waistband now with the mobile because

313
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,440
it's small I mean I'm wearing it right now and I honestly don't feel it on me I don't know where it is at

314
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:43,600
the moment because I'm on the screen it is sorry usually clip it actually on to my underwear we

315
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:49,520
stand and then there's still that layer of my pants over it but I feel it's more discreet this way so I

316
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:56,000
just clip it on there and you know the tubing is kind of hanging out but it's not really in the way this way

317
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,240
obviously we don't want anything covering the pump too much because that can obstruct connection

318
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:08,720
with the decks comp but I personally haven't noticed anything with you know signal loss or anything

319
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:16,160
like that so I find that words for me you're talking about tips and tricks for maybe clipping the pump

320
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,360
of particular way one thing that I found to be quite helpful I actually learned from another educator I

321
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:31,280
worked with is you can actually put the mobile on the clip backwards essentially or upside down

322
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:39,520
and this allows any bubbles that may form to go to the top of the reservoir or the cartridge

323
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:46,560
rather than the bottom which is where the insulin starts to be pushed out of this way you're preventing

324
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:53,680
any bubbles from going into your tubing and missing a delivery of insulin so I find that if I notice I

325
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,600
filled the cartridge and maybe there was one bubble I missed it's not the end of the world but it is

326
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:05,360
pretty hard to get out at that point so what I'll do is just put the pump upside down and clip it on and

327
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:11,520
it seems to work yeah you know there's having bubbles in a cartridge this was the first time I've ever

328
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:20,160
had to deal with that can you explain to us what happens when there is a bubble in the cartridge and

329
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,920
with Omni pod it like is it possible that there are bubbles in an Omni pod or does it

330
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:34,880
get those out like you can't see it I've never thought about that I mean for example the Omni pod

331
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:42,560
that yes you can't really see the quote unquote cartridge inside the pod but keep in mind the insulin

332
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,520
is going or any bubbles are going more to the top of the cartridge essentially or where the

333
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:57,200
cannula will be placed so depending on the placement of the pod it can push that bubble to the top if

334
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:04,160
you're wearing the cannula facing down for example similar to the movie if you're placing that

335
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:12,800
cartridge facing down than the bubble is going to go up so it's basically a pressure change when we

336
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:20,080
fill our our syringe with insulin and insert that into the cartridge there are bubbles that can form

337
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:25,440
we always say you don't want to fill your insulin pump with cold insulin because that can cause

338
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,760
pressure change it can allow bubbles to form and so if you're filling it with room temperature

339
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:40,160
insulin you're less likely to have bubbles form and then if you still do the bubbles will form but

340
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:47,840
it's important that they don't collect towards the opening of the tubing because that is going to

341
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:53,280
potentially block insulin delivery and that would just mean you're not getting your full dose which

342
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:58,000
could result in a high blood sugar so that's why we always stress flicking out your bubbles as

343
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,240
much as you can the positioning can really help with that there are different tactics we can do but

344
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,640
you know it is important to reduce the amount of bubbles okay thank you for that that I learned

345
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:17,680
something new I didn't know that stuff and I've been filling my pump up with cold insulin too so I'll

346
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:26,160
make sure to let those sit out in room temperature at a longer today's episode is sponsored by T1D Exchange

353
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:14,400
start with activity mode so one thing I needed to do with activity mode was like a lot activity mode alone

354
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:23,200
did not work for when I did like intense cardio when I was running at maybe five to eight miles per

355
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:31,360
hour fluctuating between there or whenever I do I go low and with activity mode that alone would not

356
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:37,760
do the trick I would need to put on a temp basil ahead of that and luckily with control like you

357
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:45,120
plus you can now do that what what are your kind of tips and tricks when people are for using

358
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:51,520
activity mode for people in different situations. Definitely so I got that question a lot especially

359
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:57,040
with new pump starts you know this is a very new concept that they're starting a pump for the first time

360
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:05,920
so when we do a deep dive on the activity mode basically like I said that is trying to bump up your

361
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,960
target glucose to 140 to 160 so you're getting a little bit less insulin this way up to one

362
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:21,360
correction bowl is per hour I usually say starting it about an hour before your actual activity begins can

363
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:28,640
help the algorithms are working in your system bumping up that target glucose so you go it in with a bit

364
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:35,839
of a higher glucose to basically allow for some breathing room if that activity decides to you know

365
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:40,640
make your glucose drop a little you're already bumped up a little bit so you'll have that safety net

366
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:49,680
I usually notice you know personally when I use activity mode so I think I've shared really before but

367
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:57,680
I am a local to Disneyland so I love going there all the time and you know obviously you're walking

368
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:05,600
a lot it's a big park and so I pretty much will set my exercise mode every single time I go

369
00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:13,680
you know depending on how how soon usually I forget and I'll just turn it on maybe as I'm leaving the

370
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:21,120
parking line and walking into the park but I oftentimes find I don't have as many low blood sugars

371
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:27,759
if any because I'm in that mode I already know I'm going to be more active depending on the weather

372
00:42:27,759 --> 00:42:34,240
it could be warm that day hot weather can you know sometimes make my blood sugar drop a little so I'm

373
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:40,080
already you know taking all of that into account I find that activity mode really helps because

374
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:47,279
I'm more active that way a lot of times I'll ask my patients are there any particular activities you

375
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:54,080
like to do they might like to swim they go for walks they will you know play baseball things like that

376
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,400
so I say great well then let's utilize the activity mode and just make sure you're turning that on

377
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:09,840
about in power before and then that is one feature that you will also have to manually go in and turn off

378
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:15,520
so I always say if you want to maybe set a reminder on your phone or go in and turn that off if you can

379
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,360
remember but you don't want to keep it on too long after because then you're still getting that bump

380
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:28,720
up target glucose yeah I wish they would just introduce a timer for that for both they have it for sleep mode

381
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:35,759
essentially right with the with the sleep schedules why don't they have an activity mode like timer like

382
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:42,640
it it's the perfect thing it's the thing we we really need I mean you even have that with 10 basil now

383
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:48,240
and automated I mean you get it with kind of everything you we should get it in activity mode for sure

384
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,359
because those are the times we're like okay I'm gonna go run errands for a couple hours let me put this on

385
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:59,040
and let me tell you running errands that is like this this feature may might as well be called

386
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:05,520
Aaron mode because running errands oh my goodness if you're like add it you're shopping you're going from

387
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,720
place to place like you can drop low I was in a I was low in line for addressing a room the other day

388
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,840
because we were just like popping around from the order store the other day someone asked me well what

389
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:22,080
if I am cleaning the house or doing laundry and you know I'm you know reaching into my laundry basket

390
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,240
and pulling out something to fold there you know things like that there's a lot of movement in that

391
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,840
and a lot of times they might find themselves going low while we say let's try exercise mode

392
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:37,680
or activity mode and if you find that maybe that is helping prevent those little blood sugars then

393
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,960
there's your answer you can use that for instances like that

394
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:49,839
yeah swiffering let me tell you when I swiffer I get my back into that and I I've probably gone

395
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:57,680
low 50% of the times I swear yeah no that that can definitely happen I I don't I I completely

396
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:03,040
know you're you're talking about even a lot of times people say vacuuming will do that or somebody just

397
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:10,880
yep and it's not always it's not the simple act of swiffering it's the fact that maybe I ate lunch

398
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:17,120
an hour before and took a little more insulin than I should have whatever and then that in combination

399
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:21,920
with the the action that you're putting into with the swiffer it's like that's all you needed to go low

400
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:31,440
so now with sleep mode are there ways you're you're having people use sleep mode outside of sleep

401
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:37,520
are there other parts of life where this could be a good that that could be a good moment for people

402
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:45,600
to use it I think you know obviously we want to try to use it only for the sleeping hours but

403
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,920
you know for example there was a time I'll give you a personal example where there was a period of time

404
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:59,040
where I was having low blood sugars left and right did not know it was taking place and I brought that up

405
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,640
to my endocrinologist and we decided well let's go and sleep mode 100% of the time

406
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:09,680
because you're still you know in a tighter range but you're not getting those correction bonuses

407
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:15,520
so you might get a little bit less insulin to try to bump up your your blood sugar and prevent those

408
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:21,840
lows from happening and I used it until it stopped working essentially I used it for a couple of months

409
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:28,240
was doing great and then I noticed my insulin needs changed and now I was facing high blood sugar

410
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:34,720
so I said well then let's turn off sleep mode now so I can get those correction bonuses so that would be

411
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:43,200
maybe a time obviously I always tell patients you know when you decide to use a feature like that

412
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:49,440
outside of what it's intended for it then let's bring that to your endocrinologist because they essentially

413
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:57,040
have the final say but there are ways to basically manipulate the system or optimize it fully by

414
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:06,240
using it in other scenarios than what they are intended for. Gotcha yeah I have sleep mode set to start

415
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:13,600
at 3 a.m. now I used to have it start maybe around 11 which is more true to when I was going to sleep

416
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:20,800
but the issue I found with that for me was that I do late night snacking or I'll eat dinner a little late

417
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:29,040
around 9 and I found that because sleep mode came on just two hours after that meal especially if it was

418
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:38,640
of the high fat meal that I was going pretty high a couple hours into sleep mode and I didn't have

419
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:45,600
those auto correction bonuses to get me down fast enough so then sleep mode would spend forever

420
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:53,120
trying to get me down through basil and it didn't do a good job it would take until 4 or 6 a.m.

421
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:59,279
for me to get back in the range which is really bad what are you seeing there with patients what are your kind

422
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:11,520
of go to strategies with the time that sleep mode goes on and people like routines definitely I think

423
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:20,160
I usually ask patients first what are your typical sleeping hours depending on where they are in

424
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:27,360
light you know maybe they are a working adult or maybe they are retired you know their sleep schedules are

425
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:34,160
going to change obviously so I'll use usually tell them you have up to two sleep schedules you can set

426
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:40,240
maybe a weekday profile and a weekend profile if you want or you can do every single day the same

427
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,280
sleep schedule then I'll ask them what time do you typically go to bed what time do you typically wake up

428
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,360
and then we'll come up with you know if they say oh some nights maybe seven and some nights maybe nine

429
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:57,760
we'll say let's let's come up with an average let's do eight and then it'll just start to kick in with the

430
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:05,680
option that they can also just go in and automatically or manually turn on that sleep mode and then

431
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:11,600
same thing when they wake up they can turn it off if they want I think it's a very smart you know option

432
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:18,000
that you you just share it about maybe setting it to start later into the night because yes you are going to be

433
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:25,680
getting rid of those correction bullises so if you know that you are somebody who may be snacking late eating dinner late

434
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:31,680
depending on what your diet looks like too if you mentioned you have something a little bit higher fat

435
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:37,440
potentially then you may need those correction both so you may need a little bit more insulin because

436
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:43,200
as I'm sure both of us are aware of something like pizza it's going to hit you several hours later and so

437
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:49,520
if you have pizza one night and then your sleep mode goes on a couple of hours after you may end up having

438
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:55,520
some high blood sugar you may not but you know it is it is helpful to set that sleep mode maybe later then

439
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,640
so I always just kind of try to meet that patient in the middle where they're up and try to assess

440
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:09,200
what does their typical night time routine look like and how it's sleep mode fit into that let's talk a

441
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:15,840
little bit about control like you plus so this released in the US a couple months ago it's not

442
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:25,280
outside the US just yet but it is with government agencies for in preparation for clearance

443
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:32,080
first one of the big updates was the temp basil not and not just temp basil when you're outside of

444
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:38,560
automated but now when you're in automated insulin delivery you can have that temp basil up to 72 hours

445
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:46,560
tell us a little bit about about what temp basil is and the different ways that people can now use it in

446
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:52,160
automated mode basically temp basil is a new feature as you just shared it to

447
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:59,120
tandem and especially when when you're on that control like you algorithm so now it's control like you

448
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:07,520
plus what's nice is you can basically get your standard basil rates usually you're at 100% depending on

449
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:13,200
it if you're glucose is above or below target you may you know get a little bit less or more but the

450
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:20,560
pump would do that for you but say you're normally in 100% getting your basil rates standard basil rates

451
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:31,360
now you have the option to go as low as 0% and up to 250% which means say you are for example running

452
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:39,200
higher one day maybe you're having your sick or you know you have a cold flu things like that where

453
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:44,560
your blood sugars will be a little bit more stubborn you may have higher blood sugar you can bump up your

454
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:52,480
temporary basil rate to be a little bit more than that 100% rate you could get 150 to 200 you name it

455
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:58,480
and then same thing if you're noticing you're running low one day maybe you're more active you're a

456
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:04,880
little bit more sensitive to insulin you can decrease that temporary basil rate and so again it's a

457
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:13,200
safety net just yesterday I was having a lot of low blood sugars and at a very busy day where I really

458
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:22,480
couldn't stop too much and I also was getting tired of popping glucose tab so I said let's go ahead and

459
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:30,240
put a temporary basil rate so I did that for about an hour and a half and I decreased that and I noticed

460
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:37,520
it helped I noticed my blood sugars were doing just fine and then as soon as that timer and

461
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:44,000
it essentially that's when I noticed my glucose was starting to shift up or down so it was pretty

462
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,600
eye-opening help how powerful that can be and it is a new feature and tool that you can now incorporate

463
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:55,360
it's so funny just like hearing you talk about that and this whole conversation we're having with all of

464
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:02,080
these different features and knobs that you can turn and make like increase or decrease things like

465
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:09,280
so many people who don't have diabetes have no idea all the tinkering that goes into managing diabetes they're

466
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,320
just like oh they have an insulin pump they're fine like we we have the temp basil the extended

467
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:20,560
bolus we have this that we have all these features for adjusting our pancreas needs it's just so funny

468
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:26,400
another one of those features is extended bolus which now there's been updates to that

469
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:34,799
the fact that you can extend a bolus in automated insulin up to I think it's eight hours

470
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:47,759
how are you using these yourself so extended bolus I personally don't use it too often but the times I

471
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:55,600
do are when I'm having maybe a higher carb high fat you know content meal something like pizza of course

472
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:01,520
that's the time I would normally use it so that's basically just to give a summary of what

473
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:08,000
extended bolus is for those who may not know it's basically you can take a percentage of your total

474
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:15,440
bolus for a meal up front and then a percentage the remaining percentage can hit a couple of hours later

475
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:22,400
up to eight hours as you said so it used to be before control like you plus you could only go up to

476
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:28,720
two hours now you have up to eight and we can get a little bit more into why would you necessarily need to

477
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:36,880
use it up to eight hours later but essentially you and maybe say you're taking you know a hundred

478
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:44,320
percent of your your total bolus but you decide I'm going to have a slicer to a pizza maybe I'm going

479
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:53,440
to take 30% of my bolus now and the remaining 70% to three hours later usually when that spike hits from

480
00:54:53,440 --> 00:55:02,720
something with high fat high protein sorry high fat high carb content meal so that is a time I would say

481
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:10,800
would be great to use it obviously depending on particular needs and diets everybody has a different

482
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:18,000
lifestyle they may want to use it for other meals it's not just for something like pizza but that is a

483
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,440
time you would essentially use it when you know your spike is going to hit you several hours later

484
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,880
yeah and you were saying for up to eight hours is that for people who have gastroparesis like slow

485
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:38,880
digestion yeah that's probably what we'll start seeing you know who will be using it more obviously that

486
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:46,000
is a very new feature and at first when a lot of us heard you can go up to eight hours maybe we thought

487
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:52,000
why would anyone want a bolus hit them eight hours later but when you really break it down it is for

488
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,240
things that are a little bit more individualized something like gastroparesis yes so I think over time

489
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:04,240
with this new feature we'll start to see who is actually utilizing it and when would it be most beneficial

490
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:11,360
I want to ask you a few things about the future of tandem moby and I'm going to split this up so first

491
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:18,640
if you could have any feature on the physical side of moby any dream feature what would that be

492
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:29,520
physically physically okay um I would probably say maybe having like a built-in clip but

493
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:34,560
something that would just pop in and out so if you decide you don't want to clip you can just

494
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:42,480
pop it back in but for those who do it would just simply pop out stick to that same slim profile without

495
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:49,440
having to add an extra component like the clip we have now I will say the clip we have now is pretty thin but

496
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:56,000
I know some people may feel it's still a little bit clumpy for their liking so maybe having the option

497
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:03,520
to pop in a clip and pop it back out as needed would be beneficial for those moments where maybe

498
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:08,960
they're wearing it as a patch pump or not wearing it as a patch pump they have options but it's all built in

499
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:15,520
yeah almost like the Nintendo switch the Nintendo switch has like a stand that pulls out and then

500
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:21,920
clips back in and goes into the form factor also the fact that when the moby is in its clip you can't

501
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:30,640
charge it so maybe that would help something with the help with charging for example yeah yeah I also just

502
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:36,480
find it funny that the clip was designed in a way that you can charge it I think that there's some room there

503
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:42,800
for for updates on the on the future model because this this charge is on a pad it's it's all wirelessly

504
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:48,560
charged which by the way having to bring a wireless charger and the idea of forgetting your wireless

505
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:53,840
charger adds like a whole other aspect of like packing your diabetes supplies that I

506
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:00,160
already messed up with going on a little weekend vacation and then bring my charger and luckily it lived

507
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:10,799
okay now on a software angle what area of the software what's a feature for the software that you would love to see

508
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:18,240
come to the system personally I'm very happy with the features that are available I find that the

509
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:23,760
all word great you can utilize them as needed but first thing that comes to mind is actually what

510
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:29,440
we talked about a little earlier we're having maybe a timer for the activity mode would be helpful

511
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:37,680
I would say that is just beneficial because there will be times where we forget you know maybe we're running

512
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:43,120
from the gym over to work and we've just completely forget to turn that feature back up maybe if you

513
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:48,400
I was later and then will realize well our blood sugar is high how come and you find that you're still

514
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:56,400
an activity mode so I think from a practical standpoint things like like reminders or timers would be

515
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:04,400
helpful because people with diabetes were busy people too so we have to you know have as much health as possible

516
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:13,200
in our system yeah I forgot to bring up mind so with the the form factor I would love to see

517
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:21,600
the ability to turn on suspend bolus from the button on it because every time I have to shower the

518
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:27,200
fact that I have to go find my phone to suspend bolus no I'd prefer to use the on board button to

519
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:33,520
suspend bolus I'm sure there's a you know a certain of what characters that they can create on there to do that

520
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:41,680
with software wise what I would like to see is I'm already creating these like temp bezels plus activity

521
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:49,520
feature turned on at the same time I wish that there was the ability to create customizable widgets that you could

522
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:56,000
just tap and what it does is it turns on that temp basil and activity feature it turns on sleep mode and

523
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:05,040
temp basil it whatever it is these like custom made presets would be great and they're not adding a

524
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:10,240
feature they're really just allowing you to more quickly activate some of the some of the settings

525
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:19,920
now lastly if there was a dream feature that you could see come to the algorithm what would that be

526
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:30,240
maybe I would say going to the ability for the pump itself to predict your blood sugar 30 minutes

527
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:35,920
into the future and and correct based on that I think it would be nice if we could see what those

528
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:42,960
predictions would be what is the what is the algorithm assuming we might end up at and why is it deciding

529
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:49,120
to increase or decrease our basil rate so maybe just giving us a little more information but in an

530
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:55,520
optional format I know a lot of times people have alarm fatigue and all these constant beeps

531
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:03,200
and the reminders can be a lot so having it be optional would be great but the ability to tap in and see

532
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:10,240
what are these predictions and what is my basil rate being based off of why is it increasing

533
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:15,839
why is it decreasing I think that would be pretty eye opening for sure yeah that would be great I could

534
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:23,200
definitely see it being TMI for some people but on some open source apps they do show that they do

535
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:30,160
show where glucose is going in fact actually the twist pump that's coming out which uses an algorithm

536
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:36,400
from the open source community that software does show you where your glucose is going which is exciting I

537
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,760
believe it shows you a six hour graph I think that the first two hours or where your glucose already was and

538
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:47,520
then the four next four hours are where they're going so that's exciting people will have that feature

539
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:56,160
on twist coming out and I wanted to end with this if someone's considering becoming a certified diabetes

540
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:05,200
educator what would your advice be to them that's a great question actually I think obviously I've noticed

541
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:12,240
in my experience living a diabetes but also working in the diabetes bill people the diabetes

542
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:18,160
have this sense of passion for helping others with diabetes and I think that is a very important

543
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:27,280
trait to obtain to have I would say if you're open to the idea a research how can I get to that point

544
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:33,360
obviously there are specific pathways that you do have to go through before you would qualify to become a

545
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:40,880
CDC yes but having that ability can be very beneficial because they're different routes you can take

546
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:47,520
within that as well you can do it from the dietetic standpoint you can do that from the technology standpoint

547
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:55,280
there are a lot of different avenues nursing and so I think you know I would just say do your research get

548
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:02,400
involved work with others living the diabetes volunteer get some experience and you know from that point

549
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:09,280
forward you know move next to that educational piece to get certified but it all comes down to

550
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:15,120
to passion I think you have to obviously have that passion to help others which I feel people that

551
