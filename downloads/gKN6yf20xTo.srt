00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
With loop, you can log foods using different emojis.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,920
There's like three main ones, right?

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,240
There's the lollipop, the taco, and the pizza.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,800
And these are all for glycemic index.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,360
The lollipop being the highest glycemic index,

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,560
meaning that food that you're eating will hit you the fastest

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
and pizza being the slowest, it will be an absorption time of five hours.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,760
And the algorithm gets to know this information.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,720
And I think that that's what I love so much about loop

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,480
is feeding it the information of the actual food I'm eating.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,160
It has more info than any other systems able to take

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,519
that that's FDA cleared.

13
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:40,239
That was one of the biggest reasons why I was so interested in using the app

14
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,720
because of the way it integrates food.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,760
Past just carb counting because carb counting is a science, but it's also not.

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,840
And I think that having more pieces of data to inform

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,200
how you're going to react to food, that was attractive to me.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,760
What about favorite foods? Are you using that?

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,120
I am. I tend to have a cold brew with the Choco Milk every single morning.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,520
And it's a very specific brand of Choco Milk.

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,160
So I always know what it's going to do to me.

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,080
I save that specifically as a favorite food.

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,280
There's a few other items from restaurants that are local that I've saved.

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,560
So yes, I do use it.
