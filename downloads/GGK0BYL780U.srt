Hey guys, welcome to Tech Tip Tuesday. It's my brand new segment where every Tuesday

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,560
I will be giving you the top tech tips that I know

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,880
On Tuesdays first tech tip that I'm going to give you is actually two tech tips. The first one is price matching

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,520
So did you know that a lot of stores like Best Buy and Target will actually price match other stores price

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,480
So if you see something on Amazon and you love that price, but you want it right away

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,640
stores like Best Buy and Target. I'm sure Walmart and other ones will match that price. Here's the second tip

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,880
And I just did this yesterday

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,240
stores will adjust prices if they are lowered within the return exchange period

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,560
So in 14 days a store like Best Buy and Target will match a price if it's lowered. I just did this yesterday

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,519
With my DJI Osmo Pocket which I love it was $350 but I noticed on Best Buy's website that it was

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,160
319 so I went to Best Buy. It had been eight days. I asked them for price adjustment and no problem. I got my $30

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,080
back and it was awesome. So make sure when you're buying gadgets at these stores just keep an eye on the price over

13
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,480
the next couple weeks and if it lowers, go into that store and get your money back. All right until next Tuesday

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,480
I'm Justin and I'll take you later
