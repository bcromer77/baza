00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Woosier Vest Edge in Strat Edge are finally here, or at least on Kickstarter.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I got to try Woosier out at this year's E3 and I was thoroughly impressed.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here it is.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Alright, so what do you guys have here?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We have the new Vest Edge.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This one has six transducers and it works with stereo.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So three left, three right, which makes it amazing for VR.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Because in VR you don't have 7.1 but you do have the spatial sound.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This means that let's say you get an explosion on the left.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You'll feel it from the left and then if you turn around, the feeling will go to the other side.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So you'll feel it for the right.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And we have the Strat version, which is the lighter version.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It has a very powerful component of ours that you can put either on your chest or your waist

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
or anything with it.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Basically people can do jogging with it.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The sports activities from music for gaming.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Connect to everything.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Both of the products have Bluetooth, low latency, APTX.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Catch it on.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Sure.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We're going to try the loser Edge Vest with just headphones.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We're going to start with the battlefield.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We'll see how this Vest brings me into the experience.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And I'm actually feeling the recoil against my chest.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And when there's an explosion, I kind of feel a sensation throughout my body.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh, wow.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Feels very real.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Can feel the, like, walking on the gravel right now.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Wow.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Wow.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I feel that huge explosion.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Next, I had to try out the Vest in VR because that's what I'm most excited about.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But on right here.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What's going on right here is this gentleman is using the Oculus Quest system with the Woodrow Best Edge.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And as you can see, Oculus was kind enough to put two very high quality headphones

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
in two Oculus Quest.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So we've got to connect it directly on either side for the best possible sound quality.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
There is Bluetooth support in Oculus Quest.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And there is a very handy USB-C port on the side.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But we don't have access to it yet, Oculus.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What's up.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's how it's about Bluetooth.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But overall, it's an excellent headset.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It pairs beautifully with our products.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Awesome.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, I look forward to trying it.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
First, I'm going to put a nice little face mask on.

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't want those cooties.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
There you go.

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How do I look?

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I suited up and turned on one of my favorites, Beat Saber.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The music was vibrating through my body and I felt ridiculously immersed.

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I think I enjoyed the best more with music.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The battle field honestly felt a little too real and a bit jarring.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Wow.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Beat Saber is way more fun with this vest.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Wow.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I've never played Beat Saber with vibrations running through my body.

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And that was definitely an experience.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Definitely a game changer.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So this is the loser edge vest they have a kickstarter going.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The strap is also on kickstarter.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And I'm throwing the link in the description below.

Also follow me on social media.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I got some giveaways coming and a lot of other fun stuff.

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
As always, I'm Justin.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll take you later.

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So you can position it like this.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You can position it here.

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Position it in under your jacket or everyone.

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I definitely want to try it out with VR porn at some point.

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah sure.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's what these are designed for.

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Right?
