00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Hey everyone, welcome to my channel, I'm Justin Tech, and today I want to tell you

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,000
all about the best cross-platform multiplayer games available on Oculus Quest.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,280
I have been playing my Oculus Quest a ton lately, and I want to let you know the best

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,520
games and also the easiest games to meet up with your friends who have all the different

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,560
systems, whether it be Oculus Rink S, HTC Vive, PSVR, etc., with your Oculus Quest.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,920
So, here it goes.

7
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:39,360
The first game, it's definitely my favorite, it's Star Trek Bridge crew. This game is amazing,

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,879
so basically what it is is you and up to three other people are on the bridge of a spaceship.

9
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,320
There are lots of missions to set off on, somewhere you're fighting other ships,

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,040
fighting and transporting people onto your ship, exploring galaxies, and retrieving data.

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,280
There's lots of replayability here.

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,280
And you all have different jobs, whether you're the helm, driving the ship,

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,960
or tactical, you're scanning other ships around for life-signs, or enemy ships to take down their

14
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,560
weapons and shields and shooting phasers and torpedoes, or you can be engineering where you're

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,120
repairing the ship or allocating a certain amount of power to each area of the ship.

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,200
And lastly, one of the most important jobs is the captain. So, as captain, you're basically

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,840
looking at all the missions, looking at the maps, and delegating different tasks to everyone,

18
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,640
having everyone work together. When playing online, you'll meet other players in a briefing room,

19
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,040
where you can choose your positions and levels. Sometimes, my friends and I just hang out in there

20
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,240
for a while waiting for friends to log on. And the game stays very true to the Star Trek universe.

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:47,120
I'm a big next-generation fan, and everything just makes more sense to me, like warping and

22
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:53,600
impulsing, and engines going down, and the warp core being in critical condition, like everything just

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,480
really makes more sense now that I'm living it. So, you guys have to play this game. It is the best

24
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,000
game available on Oculus Quest right now for multiplayer. And you can also play single player. Also,

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,840
one annoying thing with honestly most of the social apps on Quest is you have to create an account

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,280
externally through the Ubisoft club account. So, you'll need to make an account there, add your friends,

27
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,360
and then you'll have the friends in the game. Also, if you're in an Oculus party on the system,

28
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,640
you have to make sure you exit that before you enter the game and then create a room because you're

29
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,200
Mike won't work. So, just make sure that you're logged out of any parties before you do that,

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,480
and then you can invite your friends in. Bridge Cruise, 29, 99 on the Oculus Quest, and free on the

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:45,120
Rift. Next game is Recroom. And I've got a lot to say about this one, because there's so much you can do on here.

32
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,320
Oh, and it's free. It's kind of like an online chat room where you can create your avatar,

33
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,160
and meet up with friends in different rooms. So, you can play Disc Golf, which I highly recommend you try out.

34
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,200
There's also Paintballing, and then there's Laser Tag. I was playing a bunch of Laser Tag last night,

35
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,520
and it was so much fun. It was basically four of us four. You were two different colors,

36
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,240
and then in the Laser Tag Arena, there were also these robots that were on your side,

37
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,880
and then you could shoot the other robots and get points, and whoever got to 400 points first wins.

38
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,440
There's a bunch of different guns and grenades you can pick up, and a power weapon that spawns

39
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,960
like every three minutes. You're seriously not going to want to stop playing. And then Disc Golf was also

40
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,240
really cool. So, it's like Frisbee mini golf, and basically you're throwing these Frisbee's to get the

41
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,200
hole. It's such a great time. I've had friends from the Oculus Rift. Ask and the Quest come in,

42
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,680
and just hang out in there. So you definitely have to check out Recroom. There's way more than what I just

43
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,240
said. There's a lot of different activities. There's bowling, charades, murder mystery parties,

44
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,640
and it's super easy to invite all of your friends to play in a private room. And there's still

45
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,240
feels like every day there's something to explore. Oh, and the best part, people can join you in Recroom

46
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,640
using their smartphones, just have them download the Recroom app, and add you as a friend. Then you

47
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,160
can play with them anywhere you want. Next up is my favorite, Akron Attack of the Squirrels. This one's

48
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,880
a little different than the others, but I think it's the coolest. And that's because it's both a local

49
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,800
and online multiplayer game. In this game, one person is wearing a VR headset while others play against

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,280
them from their smartphones, so it's great for game nights, or even on video chats like Zoom and

51
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,560
FaceTime. The person wearing the headset is a big tree guarding four golden acorns. The other two

52
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,280
to eight players on their phones are squirrels running around trying to steal them. The tree can throw

53
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,560
projectiles at them, and pick up the squirrels and throw them. I think any time you include others who

54
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,640
don't have VR headsets to join in on the fun is an amazing idea, and this game executed incredibly well.

55
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,880
And we'll have you and your friends yelling, laughing, and screaming. The more players there are,

56
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,960
the crazier it gets. And what's great is the app on the phone is free, so the only person who

57
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,200
has to buy it is the person with the headset. The good news there is that the game is currently on sale

58
00:04:53,200 --> 00:05:00,880
for 1499 on Oculus and Steam. And the next one is Alt Space VR. So this is kind of similar to

59
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,840
recroom in a sense where it's kind of like online chat rooms. It's less about games and it's more about

60
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,719
socializing. And it's also free to play. So the way it works is you have kind of like your own

61
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,720
apartment, but you can go to different venues. So last night I actually went to an open mic night

62
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,160
with like 40 other people, and everyone was muted. That way no one could like boo or be mean to like

63
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,200
who was on stage. It was a very interesting experience. I went with my friend Connor. We met up at the

64
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,600
venue, and we just listened to these people on stage. There were people doing comedy. There were people

65
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,080
doing karaoke. They weren't amazing. It was interesting. It was cool. I definitely highly recommend

66
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,479
checking that app out. And also what I'm going to do is I'm planning a VR happy hour social. So basically

67
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,599
I'm going to invite all of my VR friends. I think I have like six or seven people who have VR headsets

68
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:54,719
that are like close to me. And we're all going to meet up in my apartment and all space VR and just

69
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:59,840
have a drink in our hand and hang out, walk around, socialize, and kind of feel like we're at a party.

70
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,080
We'll see how that goes and I will let you know absolutely. I've really pumped for that.

71
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:08,800
Next is Swords of Gargantua, a sword fighting game. You can play the single player campaign,

72
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,560
or join up to three others in online co-op and fight waves of enemies. I highly recommend the latter.

73
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,680
There was recently an update bringing a brand new adventure mode. This has definitely enhanced the game,

74
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,080
so if you've played it before, I recommend you try it out again. You can improve your abilities and

75
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,640
strengthen your weapons over time, and it's good to know updates are being worked on. The graphics are

76
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,800
an amazing on the quest, but it's great to meet up with friends in this hack and slash game.

77
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,680
The game is available on Steam and Oculus for 1999. Next is Orbis VR Reborn. This is the only

78
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,240
MMORPG available in VR, and while the graphics seem pretty simplistic, the game is actually pretty sophisticated.

79
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,240
Think of it as the first ever World of Warcraft of VR, but it's not as well fleshed out.

80
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,640
You're going to be a little on your own here. There isn't a lot of explaining and there isn't really a

81
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,840
good tutorial. In Orbis VR Reborn, you create a character from an assortment of options,

82
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,479
from tanks to distance fighters. You'll complete quests, play in 5 player group dungeons,

83
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,960
and up to 10 player raids. Along the way you'll get new armor, weapons, and spells.

84
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,320
MMORPGs are way more fun with friends, and that's a true here. You'll either want to make friends in the

85
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,360
game or get some friends to install the game and join you on quests and raids. I think this game

86
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,320
has me more excited for the future of MMORPGs rather than excited about the game, but I

87
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,400
had to include it in this video because it's a start of something really incredible.

88
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,960
If you're a fan of MMORPGs, I suggest you try it out. As I'm posting this video,

89
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,000
the game is on sale for 1499, and is available on Oculus and Steam platforms.

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,200
Another game I really love is Path of the Warrior. It's kind of like a first-person shooter,

91
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,680
meets Street Fighter kind of game. You can play the single player campaign, or even better,

92
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,640
jump into the game with a friend on co-op mode. They're only like 5 or 6 levels, but each one

93
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,159
is packing a punch. Pun intended. There are a bunch of combo moves and fun mechanics that keep the

94
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:06,159
game interesting at every moment. I highly recommend this game for both playing alone and with friends.

95
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,120
Oh, and you'll also get a really great workout playing this game, so if they're on some workout

96
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,599
close, then kill two birds with one stone. The game is now available on the Oculus store for 1999,

97
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,680
and the last one I say for you guys is Echo Quest VR. Now, this game isn't out yet, but I'm

98
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,240
so excited about it, and I know many other people are. I actually got to play it up to this

99
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,000
connect 6. I made a video about it, so if you want to check that out, I'll put that video right in the corner

100
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,840
there, and in the description. This game is amazing, so it's basically ultimate for his beyond steroids.

101
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,760
You're playing ultimate for his V in zero gravity in its space, obstacle course. You can grab on to

102
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,800
different obstacles, and thrust yourself forward. You'll actually have thrusters on your arms,

103
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,280
and it's kind of like quiddaged to. So you're throwing the Frisbee to your teammates, and then you

104
00:08:53,280 --> 00:09:00,880
have to get it through the goal. It's really awesome. It entered Alpha this week, and it should hopefully

105
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,160
be coming into beta, and then being released real soon. It was supposed to be released at the end of last year,

106
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,079
and it still hasn't been released, and I'm dying for it. This is probably going to be the game that

107
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:15,839
like goes on top of all the other VR social games for me, so super pumped for this. That's all I've

108
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,800
got for you guys today. Please let me know if any VR games or social apps that like I need to try

109
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,680
or anyone else needs to try in the comments below. I've really been wanting to try out once. Have you

110
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,800
guys played that? Let me know how it is down there before I buy it. Are there any other first person

111
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,000
shooters that could be fun? I need more games to play online with my friends, so let me know more that

112
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,040
you guys recommend right down there. I definitely play it on coming out with more VR videos because this is

113
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,599
like what's taking over my life right now, so stay tuned for those, want you guys to subscribe right

114
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:49,839
down there and click the bell for alerts, and if you guys enjoy this video, keep it alike. All right,

115
00:09:49,839 --> 00:10:01,599
that's all I've got for you guys today. I'm Justin, and I'll take you later.
