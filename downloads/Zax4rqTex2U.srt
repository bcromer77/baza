Hey everyone, it's Justin and I just got my VR cover in the mail and I'm super excited about it

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,720
and I want to show it to you guys and I want to try it for the first time. I had to get the VR cover

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,320
because I had a lot of friends coming over that want to try out my quest and they be sweating on my VR headset.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,640
And I don't want that. So I got the VR cover. Let's check this thing out.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:34,640
So here it is. We got the VR cover right here and it has a nice padding.

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,560
Very sturdy padding, I love that. So this is the main VR cover right here that is an insert

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,480
that I can take my insert out and put this one in. It's basically a second one right here and what's

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,080
so cool about this is that it's actually on with Velcro, right? So right there I'm able to take this off

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,800
and then if I want to put the other one on, put that one on. So I had two of these and then here come the

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,800
elastic band covers, right? So this is what I'm going to put over these things to protect my precious

11
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,960
pores from all of your sweat. So let me read the instructions which I'm really bad at doing.

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:20,960
So it looks like. So now I'm going to put one of these covers onto the facial

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,320
interface that they have here. And then there are these elastic bands that I then all I have to

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:36,640
do is just band it right there. There you have it. I now have the VR cover over that facial interface

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:44,000
and on there pretty nicely. So what's so great is that the insert that it comes with comes right out. So

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,920
I can easily change it out. There you have it and then here is the VR cover one. I'm going to

17
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:01,680
pop this in and now there you have it. My Oculus Quest now has a VR cover on it. I'm going to put it out

18
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,680
lovely and then there's their logo right there. It is hot in LA right now. So I am sweating and I'm going

19
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,840
to put this on and not have to worry about mine getting all the sweat on it.

20
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,720
And there it is. Wow nice and comfy. It's actually more comfortable than the one that it came with.

21
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,160
They also found that sometimes I would have like a little rash using mine for a while and I feel like

22
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,280
this material which is cotton will feel better on my face over long periods of time. So I'm pretty

23
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,120
pumped for that. So that is the VR cover. I definitely can just in by getting this device.

24
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,240
They make VR covers for a ton of headsets. So check out their website. I have the link below. You can

00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,040

26
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,200
your friends using your face mask. You're going to want to use a VR cover to keep their sweat off of

27
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,600
