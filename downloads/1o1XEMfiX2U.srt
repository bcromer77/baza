00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
Diabetic has an app on iPhone.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,800
Look at that, it's me.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,600
We have a new blog post every week

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,320
and a newsletter twice a month.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,400
And now with this app,

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,600
it will get sent directly to your phone as a notification.

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,720
Here's how you set it up.

8
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,280
First go to diabetic.info.

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,800
From there, click login and enter your email address.

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,000
Next, open the email on your phone

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and tap get access.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,920
Once the website opens up, click the share button.

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,480
Scroll down to add to home screen.

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,480
Then name it whatever you want.

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,200
And voila, now you have an app for diabetic.info.

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,680
Now with this app, you'll get push notifications

17
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,040
when we release our blog post every week

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,520
and send out our newsletter twice a month.

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,120
You can adjust those notifications

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,560
as you like in the settings on your phone.

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,680
Now go ahead over to diabetic.info,

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,240
