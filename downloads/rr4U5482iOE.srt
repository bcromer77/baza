00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Hey everyone, it's Justin and today I want to talk about a game that my friends and I are

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,240
obsessing over and it is a little indie game called Sun of a Witch.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,800
It's coming from the game developer Bigosore and it's available on Steam and Nintendo Switch.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,360
It's a robe-like game where you go from room to room and you fight boards of enemies.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,120
It is a huge blast to play with multiple people and also on your own.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,480
I have a lot to say about this game, so let's go.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,960
So the way the regular game works is you play as far as you can go and once you die,

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,320
you start from the beginning. But don't worry, if other people are still alive,

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,560
you'll be brought back to life. There are seven stages in total. On each stage,

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,240
you move from room to room defeating boards of enemies, stopping at shops,

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,120
completing side missions, and accessing treasure groups.

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,560
The rooms on each level are randomly placed so you never know exactly where to go without exploring.

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,440
Each stage leads up to a randomly generated boss.

14
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:58,000
There's about three different bosses that could be for each stage.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,680
Along the way you pick up items like scrolls and potions, but be careful, not every potions

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,520
you're friend, so be sure to read the labels. You'll also find powerups and pets that help aid you on your journey.

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,360
You may even find some cute little mounts that speed you up and absorb damage.

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,400
All the enemies, powerups and items are randomly generated each round, so you have to play the game

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,280
a little differently every time. There are 10 characters to choose from, many of which you need to

20
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,400
unlock with side missions. Some are close range, others are distance, and each one has their

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,480
own specific abilities, right? So the archer can shoot arrows. The alchemist can summon a creature

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,560
to fight on his behalf. The palette can create a shield. The sorceress can heal, but you aren't limited

23
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,880
to those abilities. Each character has different strengths and weaknesses, but depending on the

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,480
powerups and weapons that are dropped, you may need to adapt and change your strategy.

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,280
I've already put in over a hundred hours on this game, and that doesn't even include the

26
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,240
times I've played on my friend's systems. Besides the regular mode, there's also an RPG mode where

27
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,640
if you do die, you start in the beginning of that round instead of at the beginning of the whole game,

28
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,680
which is kind of nice if you just want to run through the game with friends and absolutely beat the game.

29
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,120
On top of that, there's a casual mode, a hard mode, and an endless arena where you fight waves of enemies

30
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,000
that's super fun. And then there's the PvP mode, which in my opinion still needs some polishing,

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
because I felt like I was just chasing my friends around forever, and it was a little tedious.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There's also a whole list of barbarian challenges, which are so freaking hard, and in order to unlock

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,440
the barbarian character, you have to beat all of them. I don't know anyone who's unlocked the barbarian.

34
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,320
I challenge all of you to unlock him. Like if you have unlocked the barbarian, please let me know in the

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,200
comments below. Bigosore, please just give me a code that allows me to unlock him. Please.

36
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,640
The multiplayer for this game is so much fun. Get up to three other friends to play with you, and you're

37
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,280
just having a ball. You get some far range people. You get someone to heal you. You get a close range

38
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,000
character, and you use all of your skills in conjunction to defeat all of the hordes of enemies and the bosses.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,359
So I do know that Bigosore is currently working on co-op multiplayer for online on the switch,

40
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,080
right now you only have the local co-op multiplayer. It's currently available on steam,

41
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,720
but the switch needs it, and he knows it and is working on it. So stay tuned for that.

42
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,440
Instead of a witch offers hours and hours of playability, amazing multiplayer, and gives you a unique

43
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,240
experience every time you play. And for that reason, I'm giving this game a five out of five.

44
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,840
Yeah, the barbarian feels like he's impossible to unlock, but that's kind of the reason I keep coming back.

45
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,600
And on top of it all, Bigosore continues to offer DLC content for free. I've got to give you

46
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,800
mad respect Bigosore because you could be making way more money by charging for this DLC in the fact

47
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:53,360
that you haven't. I mean, respect brother. Respect. It's also worth noting that the creator of this game

48
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,760
has done all of this by himself from the very beginning, and he frequently listens to his fan-based

49
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,720
and community on Reddit on how we can improve and answer questions. So I highly recommend you guys

50
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,320
check out this game on steam. It's $15 on Nintendo Switch. It's $10. I will be coming out with a

51
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,760
tips for some of which video very soon. There are so many intricate little things that you can do

52
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,200
that help you win the game. There will be a card here probably at the end once I finish it. Here,

53
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,360
here I haven't really decided yet. Other than that, I am Justin, and I'll take you later.

54
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm just so obsessed, and I think you will be too.
