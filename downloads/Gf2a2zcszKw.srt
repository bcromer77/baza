00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
Hey everyone, Justin Tech here, and today I am joined by Mr. Kane Blake of Kane's Way YouTube. Check them out, howdy.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,160
Today we are playing some V-R.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,080
He's gonna be fun. We are playing raw data, which is this first person shooter. It is multi-player,

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,120
so we are going to be playing together.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,680
Look down, look your left waist, left side of your waist, and then pick up your bow.

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:34,640
Hold it, and then you can't let go. Go get it, go get it, pull the little string part,

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,280
and then pull it back, and let go.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,640
Oh my god, the...

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,280
Oh, yeah, you're gonna do your good. Just lightly put your figure on your seat, and then press it.

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,720
Oh, you're so pretty. Now I am going to join Kane in the TRX spirit.

11
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,320
All right, Kane. Hi, I'm here. Oh, that's crazy.

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,520
We're ready. Where do you go?

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,880
Up. Way to go, right there. Hey.

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,320
And there we go. Look up.

15
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,280
Oh, howdy. What is happening right now?

16
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,200
I am freaking out. You are a high-ranking executive.

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,440
All right, so, Kane, I'll let you do the honor.

18
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:23,520
We want to go up and get that handle and pull it.

19
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,880
This is quite an important thing. I'm going to put it in that keyhole.

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,400
There we go. Nice job. The data is down.

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
Okay, see what guy coming? Put it to the right.

22
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,400
Uh-oh.

23
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,840
I'm sure that this is a bad one. I'm sure that every one is fine.

24
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,520
Oh, that's fair.

25
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,520
That's fair. So, then.

26
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,440
All right, so we're going to start coming you out.

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,479
So, put your hand in.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,600
Oh, there's so many coming.

29
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,880
I'm coming inside.

30
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Oh, come on. Come on, come on.

31
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,520
Oh, god. What is happening?

32
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Yeah, I knew it.

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,079
Oh, I just literally just got one.

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,480
Oh, there's a- this is a guy.

35
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,040
Watch out, that's not really bad.

36
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,480
We got a time.

37
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,079
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

38
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,800
Very soon.

39
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,920
They're ready. Okay, there may be drones came so keep in the air.

40
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,720
Yep, there's drones.

41
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,120
Okay, this is not big, guys.

42
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,120
Where is he? He's hiding on mom.

43
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
Where?

44
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,440
Yes.

45
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,440
Where am I here?

46
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,080
Oh, hang on.

47
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,040
Oh, hang on.

48
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,240
I'm trying to get him.

49
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,880
He's there.

50
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,520
I got there.

51
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,720
We got one.

52
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,200
Oh, there's a visible guy.

53
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
Anywhere in the visible.

54
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,800
Oh, where's mine?

55
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
You have to hit him, oh my god.

56
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
Turn you.

57
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Huh?

58
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Where do my guard? Where do I go?

59
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Turn me.

60
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Do I know?

61
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Watch out, turn me back.

62
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Oh my god.

63
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
I don't know.

64
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Do I know you?

65
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Don't hurt me.

66
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Oh my god.

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Come here.

68
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Come here.

69
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
And then down here.

70
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Oh shit.

71
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Oh shit.

72
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
At the end of the night.

73
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Nice big guys.

74
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Turn this way.

75
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Okay.

76
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
And then shoot the shoot rocket.

77
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Shoot the rocket.

78
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Oh my god.

79
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
That's hurt.

80
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Help me.

81
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
I think the gun's a bit of the matter.

82
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
There is so much work.

83
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
My shoulder is killing me.

84
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Oh my god.

85
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
This is like a one-off.

86
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Oh god.

87
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Shake it off.

88
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Shake it off.

89
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Shake it off.

90
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Oh, oh.

91
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Into the church.

92
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
About behind me.

93
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Oh my god.

94
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Oh shit.

95
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Where am I?

96
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Back down there.

97
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Where do you go?

98
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Behind you.

99
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Back you back. I died. I don't see it like him.

100
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,800
He had to use a bootcase.

101
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Nice.

102
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
All right, let's go.

103
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Let's see.

104
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
All right.

105
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Congratulations, sir.

106
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Good to see you.

107
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Can't.

108
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Okay, it's like a giving you a massage right now.

109
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Oh, so I take this off.

110
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
You lost your head.

111
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Oh my god.

112
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Yeah.

113
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Where did I lie?

114
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
I was not even in a really difficult level.

115
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Oh, my God.

116
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
I've been on part with them.

117
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
I can understand why people like

118
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
I want to stay in that world.

119
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
It literally feels real.

120
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Like, swear it.

121
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Squisting.

122
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
If you want to try VR as well,

123
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,800
you can totally check it out at any local best-byer game stop.

124
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,800
If you live in New York, like New York City or LA,

125
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,800
there's the IMAX VR experience that you can go check out.

126
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,800
And it's like $10 experience and it's definitely a good way to try it out.

127
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Thank you, Kane, for checking out the VR with me.

128
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
It was fun.

129
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Give it a time.

130
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
A little bit about your channel.

131
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
So I have a channel called Kane's Way.

132
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
You check it out at youtube.com.

133
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Flash Kane's Way.

134
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,800
And all my social media is at Kane's Way.

135
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
So check it out.

136
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Did a video with this one?

137
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Collaboration.

138
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Check it out.

139
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
We made cupcakes with other hands.

140
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
We did.

141
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
And it was a lot of fun.

142
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
