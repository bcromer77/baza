1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
The American Diabetes Association plays a crucial role in shaping diabetes care worldwide.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,440
It's standards of care set the gold standard for diabetes treatment and technology recommendations,

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,640
influencing insurance coverage here in the US, and providing essential guidance for both physicians and patients.

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,920
These guidelines help ensure that the latest advancements in diabetes management are

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,160
accessible to those who need it most. Welcome to the show. I'm just and I have

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,280
typed one diabetes in on here. I tuck off things diabetes tech news and management. Now,

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,080
one of the most exciting recommendations that has come out of the ADA standards of care most recently

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,760
is a recommendation that all people with type 2 diabetes were guardless of insulin use

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,520
should have access to continuous glucose monitors. This shift could have a massive impact on

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,080
diabetes care, expanding access to a tool that has already transformed management for so many

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:06,320
people with diabetes. Today, I'm joined by Dr. Gracia Aleppo, a professor of medicine at

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,600
Northwestern University's Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Molecular Medicine.

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,800
With over 23 years as an adult endocrinologist, she has dedicated her career to diabetes care,

14
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:25,280
especially in the realm of diabetes technology. In this episode, we dive into her work at the ADA,

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,280
how an idea moves through the organization from conception to the standards of care. The rating

16
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,120
system behind each new recommendation, we also get into the ADA's recent recommendation that health care

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,360
providers support patients who are considering DIY. Uncleared algorithms, like those I've talked about

18
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,640
on the show, whether it be trio DIY loop or Android APS. Dr. Aleppo is just as passionate about

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,960
diabetes technology as I am. Maybe even more, and you'll hear that through her voice. Keep in mind that

20
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,280
anything you hear on the show or any of my pages is not medical advice and it's for educational

21
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,480
purposes, only always consult with a physician before making changes to your health care. Now for the

22
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,720
conversation. Gratia, welcome to the show. It's so good to have you here. Thank you so much, Justin

23
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,040
for having me here today. I'm excited to be here with you today. So I'm Gratia Leipop, my professor of medicine

24
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,560
at the Division of Endocrinology Metabolism Molecular Medicine and Northwestern University in Chicago.

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:33,680
I've been working as adult endocrinologists for about 23 years now, and I dedicated my career to diabetes,

26
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,600
particular diabetes and technology. For the last three years, I've been working with the ADA Professional

27
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,079
Practice Committee to work on the standards of care, and I was assigned to be the lead

28
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:53,840
the chair of the diabetes technology section, which is chapter seven. The ADA is something I hear about

29
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:01,920
all the time, but I don't actually know that much about it. So when the opportunity came about to have

30
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,320
you on the show to talk about not just the ADA, but the standards of care, I got super excited and

31
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,359
I'm so happy to have you here. So let's start with the biggest news that's come out from the ADA,

32
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:23,600
which is the addition in the 2025 ADA standards of care. It now includes a recommendation for the

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,359
consideration of continuous glucose monitors for adults with type 2 diabetes, whether they're using

34
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:39,200
insulin or not. Tell us about what led to this addition. Not only that is there was a new recommendation

35
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:48,320
last year for type 2 people and adults that should use CGM when they use basal insulin, but we also decided

36
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:56,560
to look into people with type 2 diabetes, not on insulin. And so the newest recommendation is 7.16,

37
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:05,600
that says consider using CGM in adults with type 2 diabetes, not using insulin or on glucose

38
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:12,400
laboratory medication other than insulin. And this is a level of evidence great beat. So let me explain to

39
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:20,000
what that means. First of all, we felt that we should sort of put together and accumulate the

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,840
recommendation for CGM for people using insulin with a type 1 type 2 kids adults didn't matter.

41
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,000
So that is important because the data is so strong so we want to put that aside in just one and sort of

42
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,440
combine a few recommendations. And then we thought we need to do one for type 2, not using insulin. So we

43
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,880
had to look in the literature and there is growing evidence that there are benefits for people with type 2 using

44
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:56,880
CGM, not using insulin. And so we had to look into the growing research and growing papers

45
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,719
and they were able to say now we feel comfortable that it is efficient evidence to state that yes,

46
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:09,920
we should consider. Now why do we not use recommend? Because right now we don't have large randomized

47
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:16,320
control trials, we have some randomized control trial, a lot of retrospective information and some

48
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,120
perspectives. So we needed to make sure we use the right level of recommendation to mirror the

49
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,040
evidence that we have. And that's how we came up with the work consider and the evidence level B.

50
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:40,480
So how long were you considering this addition before you actually implemented it? How many trials and studies

51
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:46,960
did you need to see to be like okay we're confident that we're going to recommend to all people

52
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,600
with type 2 diabetes on insulin or not? So the challenge is that with the standards of care we have a

53
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,800
huge responsibility because it's not just for the US, this recommendation and the guidance I've read by

54
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,680
people all over the world. So when you make a statement you need to make sure you can support it with the

55
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,640
literature behind it. So I've been looking for the literature for the last two years and I'll remember

56
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,640
we prepared their guidelines the year before. So they're published December of let's say 2020,

57
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:23,520
4 for 2020, 5 but we start in March and so we need to accumulate evidence that has been already published

58
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:31,840
or can be published by let's say the deadline whatever changes every year. So we might not get to use it

59
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,600
because it was after the deadline. So you need to keep in mind that if you have an idea about what should

60
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:45,200
be put as a new recommendation to start gathering information sometimes it's a year before and so we want to

61
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:52,560
make sure that we wanted to put this recommendation out people need to understand that it doesn't take two days

62
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,600
to get this idea this year. So we need to have enough publication that make the recommendation solid.

63
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,840
So that's why it takes so long to put a recommendation. And within the standards of care you said like

64
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:14,800
at 16.7 there's a line that says this 7.16. Okay 7.16 okay I remember that oh I was close. So if I wanted to

65
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,640
learn more about how that got there is there a way to like click in there and then it shows you all

66
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,840
of the studies that were considered or that. Actually the studies are cited. So if you go to

67
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:33,039
the chapter 7 of the standards of care is diabetes technology you can see that every is the recommendation

68
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:39,200
isn't the in the in the in the pink and said but then in the text it tells you exactly what the studies

69
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,800
were the supported. So you can go to the reference the biography at the end of the chapter and see which studies

70
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,800
were used to make this statement. And there were several we had to sue the come up because again

71
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:58,400
that having two or three large randomized controlled trials we used everything available within the 12 to

72
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:06,560
maybe 12 months or so 18 months or so to bring their recommendation to life. So you need to really

73
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,360
dig into the literature and find the as much as possible but also as to be recent it cannot be five

74
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:22,240
years ago obviously. Okay so once these recommendations go into the standards of care what kind of

75
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:31,600
happens next with those who is that signaling how are people hearing about this who is keeping their ears

76
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:40,080
open for something like this. So there is a great amount of um tripidation expectation in December when

77
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,920
the guidelines get published online everybody weighs for the days what is doing we try to go

78
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,080
through the pages right but also the message is there to for other people's other people to read and we are

79
00:08:52,080 --> 00:09:00,240
hoping that by putting the recommendation in the standards of care then there will be a follow-up of payers

80
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:07,040
because you see the job of the recommendation is to put it there is the literature supports it so it's a true

81
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,120
statement it's not because when they are woke up or someone's teaching for everybody and I just want to

82
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:19,280
do I can't do that within working at the ADA volunteering that is. So once the evidence is there then we are

83
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:28,319
hoping that they will transform into coverage for example. When there was the recommendation for type two

84
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:34,160
on basal instantly from the mobile trial few years ago that then became that made the care that it

85
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,439
covered in CGM for basal instantly instead of you know multiple that injection for type two and then

86
00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:46,880
that followed by the insurance the payers. So it starts someplace but you need to again go back to the evidence.

87
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,319
So now that we have the evidence and we have put this recommendation we're hoping that with time the

88
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:59,120
payers will read this and understand that they should extend consider like we said the use of CGM and people

89
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,040
without taking in so because many people today are able to come off of insulin when they use GLP for

90
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,360
example and then they're using the CGM when they are on insulin and GLP whatever the medication is and then

91
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,680
when they're off they're faced with the fact that they might not be able to afford there anymore and they

92
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,200
becomes really difficult because they really want to see that information so that's my clinical experience.

93
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,760
On the guidelines part we are hoping that when we put the information as a new recommendation there will be some

94
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:36,319
sort of a awareness and hopefully coverage in the future. So you mentioned GLP ones in there and I just

95
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:43,040
want to stick with that for a second is that making your recommendations for type two a little more tricky

96
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:50,400
just because of how that's affecting people with type two and how they may not need insulin or CGMs

97
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:57,920
because of that no okay but remember when people are treated today they should receive GLP because it's

98
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:06,560
such a great medication for many benefits cardiovascular unaymen or say but often what happens is that a

99
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:14,640
patient is an insulin that studies in CGM the glucose gets better and they might be able to come off of

100
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,960
insulin because it's not just a GLP it's a combination of GLP and CGM and the literature supports that so the

101
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:30,319
combination of those two enhances the benefits so in fact when you add CGM to GLP you make the glucose even better

102
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:35,600
so having that information that immediate feedback enhances their ability to self-manage.

103
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:45,920
When you're adding these recommendations are they always based off of what drugs are indicated for and what I mean

104
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:54,000
by that is many people with type one diabetes are finding success with GLP ones because it stabilizes their

105
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,440
blood sugar levels and they have much better control but it's not indicated for that doctors can't

106
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:09,120
prescribe it for type one would the ADA look into that now that's beyond this code it's not

107
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:17,840
part of what the standards of care are they are a way for us to research the literature and bring up

108
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:26,160
new recommendation based on the literature weight now sometimes this my results in approval systems or

109
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:33,280
indication of medication but it's not the role of a DA to promote that totally that makes sense

110
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:41,439
this episode is sponsored by OmniPod as someone with T1D and with an incredibly active lifestyle it's

111
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:47,439
important for me not to get tied up especially with tubes on my insulin pump I love to go swimming

112
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:53,439
lift weights and play kickball with friends and with OmniPod 5 I never have to worry about tubes getting

113
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,960
in the way plus not having to disconnect helps me to stay in range during all of my favorite physical

114
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:05,600
activities that includes sexy time too see if you're eligible for a 30 day trial by visiting OmniPod.com

115
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:12,400
slash dive tech on there you'll see full safety and risk information and trial terms that's OmniPod.com slash

116
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:20,720
dive tech you mentioned that the ADA has had an impact on coverage can you kind of tell me about that a

117
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:29,600
little more have you seen direct influence on the CGM world with coverage so it's yes and no so the

118
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:37,520
ADA puts out the information that is available in the literature and by doing so hopes that there will be

119
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:45,280
an impact and some recognition from the payers who then are able to accept that those guidelines are

120
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,760
strong enough support enough the literature that there are benefits and therefore patients can take

121
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,880
they have benefits of using these tools and they can cover them so they don't specifically drive that but

122
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,240
definitely the fact that the guidelines are out there and there are supportive of such a very strict

123
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:11,839
method of vetting the literature shows that if a recommendation isn't the guidelines as merits to consider

124
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:19,600
the coverage from the payers we want to also make the providers aware because you see providers

125
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,160
do so much for patients so when you see that there are more evidence there is more information about a specific

126
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,240
to in this case CGM and they provide the reads that they are more encouraged than use these systems and by

127
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,720
doing so they give more information they give more knowledge so it's not just for payers the ADA guidelines

128
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:49,120
to help people who practice medicine to do better for their patients is ADA leading any type of

129
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:58,080
charge or is anyone to get not just people in the diabetes space like endos and diabetes educators to read this

130
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:05,120
but but primary care because you know my primary care misdiagnosed me for six months with type two

131
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:14,240
diabetes is is there any form of you know education through the ADA to educate people outside there who can

132
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,640
also get involved even with insulin pumps right just for their their patients who don't have the ADA is not for

133
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:28,000
endocrinology it is for every person in medicine who wants to understand diabetes and improve their knowledge

134
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:35,120
and in fact the mission is to improve the care prevent and hopefully cure when they diabetes

135
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:43,920
but also expand and others to everybody people with diabetes provider is clinicians nurses medical assistance

136
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:50,240
anyone primary care and especially primary care because there are many more people with diabetes especially

137
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,720
type two that they see compared to endocrinologists because there are a few of us so the ADA

138
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,920
mission it really expand the knowledge and to take care of people with diabetes so there are a bunch of

139
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,240
volunteers that in the families and caregivers and healthcare professionals and also professionals

140
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:16,480
as well but the idea is a family is not just a book that comes once a year truly is an entity that supports the

141
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:25,040
people who have diabetes you mentioned before you use the word volunteering is the work you do at the

142
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,840
ADA are you volunteering that time? Absolutely. Strictive volunteers so it is a great privilege to be

143
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:40,560
invited to be in the professional practice committee because the ADA chooses he clinician and so that you get

144
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:47,520
invited is a huge honor because you are a huge responsibility so it's all on a volunteer basis and you

145
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:53,200
spend many months and I did this for three years I was so privileged to be able to do that and offer

146
00:16:53,200 --> 00:17:00,560
whatever knowledge I had but also to look for papers, literature, think about new recommendation and to

147
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,640
sort of expand the thing that was assigned to which was the chapter seven so yes that's why it's so

148
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,080
important because being a volunteer you really have to be engaged and wanted to do it because you

149
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:19,280
to meet over and over again to make sure that these guidelines are voted on that we sort of a

150
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:26,000
wordsmith we adjust every word there is okay it's not a chance that there is a word there that is written

151
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,080
because we just didn't realize we had to pick and choose everything the word so that the message is very clear

152
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:39,439
so we have to go through 80% debt to represent the agreement and the voting every single recommendation

153
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:48,000
gets through voting more than one sign one more the one cycle excuse me so it's truly a coming together

154
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,520
of the minds and the people who have expertise and then looking into make recommendation to improve the

155
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,840
life of a person with diabetes and then the health wow well thank you for all the time you spend on this

156
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:10,240
the ADA standards of care are considered the gold standard why is that because first of all there are

157
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:18,960
really objective there is no industry support it's only funded by the ADA the work is done by volunteers

158
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,440
we have to declare a conflict of interest and so when you have so much strict sort of criteria

159
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,880
you're not putting a recommendation because you want to help a company or the other it's nothing

160
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,360
like that you want to make sure that the data they're available some of the people that done with the

161
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:42,320
this industry government funded NIH fund the studies or foundation like GDRF or breakthrough type one

162
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:53,840
has validation when we have this so much strict criteria that we can say we feel comfortable the

163
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:03,439
we have set truthful information that it can be vetted look up and so there is no it feels like

164
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:10,879
it's really a transparent what would you say are some other pivotal endeavors that the ADA has led

165
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:19,040
up until now things that the ADA has done that you that you're proud of they do so much advocacy

166
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:25,920
it is incredible so much advocacy for just about everything diabetes but also a lot of things

167
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,480
programs for the person with diabetes and not just a provider so there are two different components

168
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,399
professional ADA component and the person with diabetes if you go to ADA or G they be the

169
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:43,200
store or G excuse me so diabetes that work you see recommendations information resources for people

170
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,240
with diabetes and the professional component as well so the ADA doesn't just want to write

171
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,680
recommendation for physicians or clinicians it was to write information and support the

172
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:00,480
person with diabetes it even has information on counselors psychologists he has a time and range

173
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,880
information to understand what time and range is it tells you about food exam I exam so many things that are

174
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,320
for the person with diabetes they also a component of diabetes education that is very important where

175
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:20,000
specific criteria by which a center can have accreditation from the ADA for diabetes education

176
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,919
or institution has an accreditation center and it's a specific benchmarks and so it's got a lot of

177
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,679
and a lot of work that surrounds the person with diabetes it sort of 360 wraps around the person

178
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:40,000
I can I can just feel and see your passion and your enthusiasm for this and it's it's fun to work on

179
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,640
something that you feel so passionate about tell us a little bit about your background what kind of

180
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:51,920
lead to this and how did you get involved so I've been practicing for more than 20 years in Chicago

181
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:59,200
Northwestern University and I have a passion for diabetes that was started when I was a fellow and so I

182
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:07,200
really felt that diabetes technology was the answer and to me when I was a fellow when CGM was initially

183
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:13,280
brought to them at 25 years ago was brought to the market and I thought this is the tool that is

184
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,560
going to change the way we treat people with diabetes and I feel that the CGM is the next

185
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,040
important thing after insulin discovery because without CGM we wouldn't have anything else like

186
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:33,120
AID system automation integration and nothing like that so that made me truly become so engaged with

187
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,800
the person with diabetes the technology in those days they were not even covered my patients

188
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:46,640
would pay before 2008 before the in JDRF study patients would pay because the aha moment

189
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:54,000
the fact that they could reduce hypoglycemia was so important and so and my practice grew because

190
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,720
I really was just engaging with with technology from day one and so then I got much more experience

191
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,240
I started with some clinical trials I did a lot of clinical trials that really shaped CGM the

192
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,760
replace BG was the trial that allowed CGM to become non-agent so you don't have to break your finger anymore

193
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,760
and we had to prove that so we did decide to say we know that it's safe we need to prove it to everyone so

194
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:26,080
there was an important study and that in many more studies on other I did the mobile study for CGM and

195
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:33,840
without multiple injections and so forth AID studies so I've gathered some expertise and then the

196
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:40,879
ADA invited me and I thought it was the greatest thing so I thought I felt so honored to be able to participate

197
00:22:40,879 --> 00:22:46,480
it's a big responsibility because these guidelines are right by so many people and yet to make sure again

198
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,480
it's not just that your way is a lot of the world or whatever you say it's also can be done not just in America

199
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,880
but also all the countries so you want to be really smart and you have to be really attended to what you say

200
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,560
what would you say is one of your greatest achievements at the ADA

201
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:14,400
that I was able to really work with them for the chapter seven they believe technology and expanded

202
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,480
and the people before me did a great job they basically started from scratch and then I felt

203
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,880
that my role was to grab the literature now and expand the recommendations so we did over the

204
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,840
last three years we've added many recommendations we made many much stronger recommendation and stronger

205
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:44,000
sort of statements to truly say this is here to stay for example AID system now they become preferred

206
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
because the data is so strong for therapy we type one for example where you know that the amount of

207
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,840
diabetes I'm sort of glycemic well nice is so much better with the ADA then we let's say stand

208
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,400
upon so multiple the injection but this is because there have been so much data generated so we've

209
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:07,040
been able to grab it and expand it we also what I'm very happy about this past year the this year should

210
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:16,640
say recommendation is the one about the Open APS so used to call it the YI but we call it Open APS so

211
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,400
there are these systems that are not necessarily FDA approved but they're out there for people with

212
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,200
joined is we're not waiting movement and so now there's more and more evidence that shows that these

213
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:37,440
systems help the patients so even though the algorithm is not approved the other components of the

214
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,440
pump and the sensor are approved and it's our job to support the patient into their journey and if they choose

215
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,880
to be on a system that needs their needs then my job is to also support them and today we have

216
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,040
evidence that is growing it says yeah these systems are actually safe and so some have been approved

217
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,800
hopefully more will be approved in the future but nevertheless there was one thing that are so happy to put

218
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:09,840
in this 2025 guidelines that say think about the patient already comes to us with an Open APS know the

219
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:16,560
literature which we explain in the in the narrative and say yeah this can be used you need to support

220
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:22,399
the person with diabetes and that they come with the two pieces there are the sensor and the pump are

221
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:28,800
approved the piece in the middle is not but there are you know safety measure in place you work with your

222
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:35,760
patient and you support the patient to meet them where they're at. Yeah that's very cool and I do a lot of

223
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:44,320
work in the DIY space open APS throughout my channels I talk about it a lot I've I've used many of them

224
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:54,560
and they are they're fantastic and a lot of people swear by them can you tell me more about what has just

225
00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:01,520
gone in in that realm they're you're saying there are recommendations for this like what is what is what has

226
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:09,760
the ADA said when it comes to these systems and are they encapsulating like say DIY loop trio

227
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:16,320
AAPS Android APS like all of these are they encapsulated. Well we're not giving names we just

228
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:24,160
say no names what we can't right so what we're trying to say is in the recommendation to support

229
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:30,560
the patient with diabetes they use this this systems because that is growing evidence in the literature that

230
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:38,399
these are safe so it's about supporting the recommendation is to A be aware and be to support the

231
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:45,280
patient and use system so it's really again about the human with diabetes it makes sense yeah

232
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,919
we can't say recommend because they're not if they are approved but we need to support the patient

233
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:56,000
who uses them and that's where the recommendation is all about. Yeah and that's what the community wants

234
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,160
it's what the patients want the patients when they go into their office talking to their

235
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:08,160
doctor about this system they don't want to just be told no not with me goodbye they want at least be

236
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,440
spoken to about it right at least for it to be considered and a lot of people are just shut down

237
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,800
well there is a challenge there so some some provider might be familiar with the system so we need to

238
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:24,639
also understand and that's why also there is information and the narrative because once you read the

239
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:29,680
guidelines you have the narrative that tells you this is what the study shows so you have plenty of

240
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:35,280
opportunity to become educated so you want to do with the providers so I can't respect the somebody

241
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,240
as infill comfortable because they are not aware or they're not familiar with the system and they

242
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,440
will be one of the situation it's so we're hoping that in the future there will be more knowledge and that's

243
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:53,040
why we say support the patient that is there are these tools and sometimes a provider is interested in

244
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:58,640
to try to learn more sometimes they might feel uneasy and you cannot judge the provider either because they

245
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,000
feel that the license might be a risk and yet to sort of going to this gray area but if you if you

246
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,280
a clinician is comfortable with these systems they're willing to work with the patient that is wonderful

247
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:15,280
that's when they are supporting the patient okay I'm going to put the standards of care in the show

248
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:21,440
notes for this so people can go and find it if they were to go in there where can they find this literature

249
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:30,639
about open APS so in the narrative so in chapter seven with the recommendations a bit about the end

250
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:41,440
after during the AID sub chapters sort of a subsection you read the description of the study that we use to

251
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,360
make this statement and there is the references the references you go to the the back of the chapter

252
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:54,080
and you look all the papers that we use to generate the recommendation and to generate the language and

253
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,480
explain what this system's Duke now this is not the certification on the open APS because it's within

254
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:08,880
AID cgm it connect the pencil it can just write such a long thing but the paper that were utilized

255
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:15,280
they had the better the basic evidence are reported very so you can go and look at them if you want to

256
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:22,160
look more about it I want to as well so that was just as much for my audience as it was for me because

257
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:28,560
I'd like to to read up on you know what people are reporting about these systems but we also

258
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:34,880
expanded the AID portion because since last year there have been so many more tools that have been approved

259
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,080
and more literature available we had to make sure that it was really about what this system do so it's very

260
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:46,880
detail so that's why it's an educational basically a document because you want to learn more about

261
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,680
AID system you go to the chapter you have a lot of information on what the studies for what they showed

262
00:29:53,680 --> 00:30:00,720
what the results were the population that was what these tools do and don't do and and even we put that

263
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,240
that is you know one tool that was approved for type 2 diabetes of course we don't say the name because we don't

264
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:14,160
want to be you know we cannot make specific branding name but we know that before the end of the year one brand was

265
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:23,040
approved for type 2 diabetes of AID and other two so we're trying to again be as up to date as possible to say

266
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,400
this is what they are you can educate yourself and learn about how to take care of patients

267
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,560
one to use an AID even if you imprimity care why not it's good to know

268
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:41,200
today's episode is sponsored by T1D Exchange you can directly make an impact on diabetes health care

269
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,760
treatments and technology by participating in the T1D Exchange registry it starts with the simple

270
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,760
survey about your life with T1D and it only takes about 15 minutes after that you'll have a personal portal

271
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:00,400
with ongoing T1D study and survey opportunities plus some of these studies even offer compensation

272
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,520
signing up with the link in the show notes help support my channel and it allows me to continue putting

273
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:13,760
out free content you can sign up at t1dxchange.org slash diabetic or click that link in today's show notes

274
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:25,680
who exactly is on the decision making side of the AIDA you were brought on who else is being brought

275
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:34,480
on to this so we have board well it's a different layer so the professional practice committee has several

276
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:43,440
key leader clinicians okay clinicians with a lot of expertise either in diabetes, in hypertension

277
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:51,120
pharmacology, in kidney disease in different areas of the guidelines we all get to pediatrics and adults

278
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:58,480
both in geriatrics all these people get together and we are assigned needed to be the lead of a section

279
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:05,360
or the in the subcommittee for other chapters so we don't just do one thing we do four or five and then

280
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:13,360
we meet very often I'm saying for each chapter that we have assigned and we go over the previous

281
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:20,560
literature we look at the new literature we come up with new recommendations or we say and then we have

282
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:26,720
to vote on this in different stages we vote first as a preliminary vote to see if they can go through

283
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:33,360
if they're my new like a minimal changes then we vote on the minimal changes but the ones that are new

284
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:41,440
need to be presented a yearly meeting so we meet together to the meeting in the AIDA headquarters

285
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:49,920
where we go through the entire new recommendation one by one it's what takes two days and then we have

286
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:57,120
the voting which is the professional practice committee they two chairs people help us with the literature

287
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:04,320
evidence to understand by the evidence epidemiologists and then these go to peer review

288
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,920
and then they go to the board so that we get feedback and then well that's happening we need to work on the

289
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:19,120
narrative to report and so in a narrative fashion right what we put into the recommendation and

290
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:25,280
sort of support what we say in the recommendation the values article the support the recommendation

291
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:32,560
with the way to update hundreds and hundreds of references every year then it goes to production

292
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:37,280
they give us the proof we have to go one more time to read them all make sure there is no confusion in the

293
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:46,320
editing and then finally goes to diabetes care for proof proof proof in there for how does a recommendation

294
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,720
get you know put on the pedestal is it someone just like you or anyone else that's like I think that

295
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,680
this should be something that we start looking at and then it you know goes up the chain how is that

296
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,000
starting what depends what you're talking about right so if this it's a new medication you're

297
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,760
recommendation for a particular medication it's okay it's time for this new topic to be placed in

298
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:16,880
the guidelines we're proposing so when we meet together for our chapter or section assigned to us we say

299
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:22,880
because we basically know what's going on in the particular area we feel okay this is time to start

300
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:29,360
thinking about this topic and how should we go about it can it actually become a recommendation many times

301
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:35,120
we don't get them they don't make it to the recommendation because it's the premature the restoring

302
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:42,480
of supporting literature it may be controversial it's not ready so we wait and we be waiting for some

303
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,760
things like the type two neurons we had to wait to get more literature for example and so and then we

304
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,240
present the new recommendation to the entire committee and they can say yes and they can start by vote we

305
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:04,240
need an 80% vote to pass that's a proposal you recommendation need to present it present the papers that I

306
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,920
actually chose discuss the papers so I'm not just these are the papers explain what they are

307
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,920
what level evidence what kind of side of the are the rocker and the mice and the retrospective

308
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:20,880
perspective so to explain with the entire team what this is about and then we go through the writing of it

309
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,400
towards smitting and then the level of evidence we need to decide what what are we going to assign to it

310
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,480
and then it goes to voting and sometimes something has to be changed even after it because they might say

311
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,600
I approve the language but not the level of evidence so you need to go back and forth to say

312
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,240
it's a B is a C it's a B is a A what is it so we need to tell me more about that and you mentioned it earlier

313
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:53,600
the the CGMs for people with type two diabetes without insulin got a B rating and there's an A B and C

314
00:35:53,600 --> 00:36:00,240
rating can you kind of walk us through what the differences are between those three so evidence A is the highest one

315
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,640
it is from well conducted large randomized control trial can be 20 people it's to be a bigger number

316
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:14,000
and you have to have two arms yet to have the control and the intention right and the experimental

317
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:22,319
arm otherwise there is no it's biased so then B is evidence from less regular study smaller study and then

318
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:29,040
C is observational so retrospective perspective there is no intervention just observe what happened if you

319
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,279
put somewhere on CGM this is what happened right but for the for the CGM for people with type two without

320
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:43,600
into there were a couple of randomized control study not big smaller and a lot more small study with less

321
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:52,640
rigorous methods so this is where the B came in do you think that there has been enough studies in the last year

322
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,960
to to move it to an A or is there still a lot of work left they don't know they're not published yet right so I don't know

323
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:05,520
that when do they publish we don't know so we are going to ATTD conference in Amsterdam next week

324
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:12,240
they will be ADA so I hope to see more information at those two conferences and so there will be a great place

325
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,000
to say okay there is more movement more studies have been done and so once the studies are done and they're

326
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:26,240
published then they can be considered okay okay are you and the other people in the ADA are you going to

327
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:33,600
these conferences and searching out for these new studies and saying oh this one could be used

328
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:40,000
for that and we could maybe get it to an A or you know you're kind of pulling this information out looking at

329
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,440
all that stuff yes I go to the conference quite often but that is not sufficient because a conference

330
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:52,160
usually has an abstract okay so that abstract needs to become a publication because if it doesn't go

331
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,200
from abstract to publication you can think what happened did they have enough information to be published

332
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,960
in peer view journals sometimes you go to a discomfort they present a result and there's a paper that

333
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,080
gets released at the same time so you can see there is more information and so we go to the conference we see

334
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:15,200
what's out there we get information about what the what the new things are we hope to see those

335
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,520
presentation become manuscript published in the literature so we can then read them and say

336
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:32,720
are they go standard a recommendation studies or not okay is there like an ADA certificate you know

337
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,960
how you buy a piece of food and it's like USDA certified or whatever it is like is there a stamp of

338
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:46,480
approval that the ADA gives no no no no no this is again what the standards of care are truly to

339
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:53,600
engage with the clinician to improve their knowledge and by doing so improve the care they deliver to

340
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:59,280
people with diabetes there is no stamp but the guidelines and a live but it would be a cute stamp

341
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,200
but you see the guidance and a live document they get updated if so let's say something important

342
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,480
happens between now and December there's a live update because you don't want to wait another year to

343
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,960
put another update it makes sense so the beauty of the guidance it's a continually it's a dynamic

344
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:23,040
document that's in stay there petrified for years age changes every single year that's a lot of work to

345
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:31,200
change 300 pages of documents be if there are important updates we put them out as a live update so that is also

346
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,720
how involved you need to be an up to date to make sure that if some becomes your attention say

347
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,040
hey we need to change it because what was said six months ago now is the long goodbye I need to do

348
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:50,000
something else so we updated to make it more current okay okay what are you hearing may come next for the

349
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:59,040
standards of care are there some talkings of upcoming stuff that you think will be exciting

350
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:06,640
so the thing that excites me the most is that I'm waiting for the next version of the guidelines

351
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:13,040
based on what I might see at the conference so there is so much out there but again so much can be

352
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:20,320
just a femurus it happens when they never becomes anything else so once it becomes part of the the

353
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:25,920
guidelines the standards of care that we know that whatever was seen in conference on papers and literature

354
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,200
was strong enough to give people the confidence that can become a recommendation we are waiting for so

355
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:38,800
much more stuff miniaturization of systems more data for type 2 diabetes and AID I'm hoping to see more

356
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:47,280
data of this kind of studies because type 2 patients really can use AID system but it's successful and so

357
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:54,000
I'm looking forward to see some presentation at the ATTD they will be presented for a study that was done

358
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,640
so I'm looking forward to see what they're going to say and if they will influence the guidelines I don't know

359
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:05,600
but it would be nice to see more data on people with type 2 using technology yeah I was that was my next

360
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:14,319
question was if AIDs for people with type 2 would kind of be next on the docket a lot of pump companies are

361
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:23,920
already pushing their pumps to support that but I'm sure the ADA coming out with a recommendation for that would

362
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:31,680
really push it but but we need the data just as these companies say our products work for these people

363
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:38,400
doesn't necessarily mean that these people need it or it's recommended right the beauty of this is that

364
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:45,040
once you do a study and you publish it they study is be looked at with the fine tooth comb but a bunch of

365
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,920
reviewers and not just get published because you wanted to be published it goes back and forth so if there is a

366
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,960
publication that really supports strongly but something is that good then the ADA will look at

367
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:01,920
it say hey maybe we should put this in the guidelines because the study was done so well so we're looking so the

368
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,120
companies can say whatever they like of course they support their products but we need to at the publication

369
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:13,360
the support their statements as it makes sense so people with type 2 they have been at some point they need

370
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:18,800
insulin and a lot of challenges with multiple that injection because they forget to take four to five

371
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:25,840
injections per day and the absorption can be maybe not super good because they take a lot of insulin but the

372
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:32,560
ADA system some of them do phenomenal for these patients will the literature support it will find out soon

373
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:40,400
we go to the conference next week well so my I'll see you there and this episode I think is releasing on the

374
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:48,560
Monday of next week so we should meet up and be like go watch our episode so I know a lot of

375
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:56,240
tech companies CGM pump companies they put out research they fund research do you

376
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:04,320
scrutinize that any differently than if it were just some research lab do you or do you you know

377
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,560
you look at the data that they're providing and it's you know you verify it so if I participate or

378
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:17,680
I'm invited to participate in a study sponsored by an industry a manufacturer I want to make sure

379
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,960
the study when I read the protocol that is done the protocol has some weight and if it doesn't I give my

380
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,280
feedback but once I participate my job is to do the best that I came to conduct the study in the most

381
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,840
rigorous ways when the results are published they are real they're not fake they're real and they make a

382
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:42,160
difference otherwise what why do they study spend so much money because it's not cheap and so I've done and I feel

383
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:50,560
privileged because I get to see firsthand the challenges the things that can become problematic but also work on

384
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,680
engaging with the participant and then it's such a beautiful thing the person who does the study the clinical

385
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,919
the person that's participating in the study the patient with the partner type too they engage with you

386
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:08,319
for those for many months they are so enthusiastic they are at least in what I practice they're they're

387
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:14,240
they're looking for to say that one of the study with you because they get to try these things first hand I think it's

388
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:20,399
wonderful and so you have a component of yes in the industry sponsor but they make the money the the

389
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,960
machine I can't get myself right but then the patient we the participant we use and we engage with them

390
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:33,280
they get so much benefit out of it and I learn the pros and cons and that is presented and that is published

391
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,400
and then we can say okay and also depends on what it's published and it makes a big difference because

392
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:45,360
some journalists have a higher standard than other ones right so if you get exposure in a pretty

393
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:51,120
renowned journalist you think okay it was done with the right criteria and you can really sort of

394
00:44:51,120 --> 00:45:00,000
look at the data and be comforted what is written it's really what happened the FDA recently released guidance

395
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:08,880
for AI artificial intelligence you have Dexcom who's implemented AI into their stelo cgm for people

396
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:17,280
a type two diabetes is AI something the ADA is already looking at as something you know that could

397
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:25,600
kind of fall into your laps I can't speak to that really what I'm looking forward to seeing is results from

398
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:33,760
study using AI and how we can that help the patient with diabetes in a easier life so my in my in this moment

399
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:41,120
my response would be okay see what's going on are there studies do using AI to help people recognize food for

400
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:48,800
example meal so carbs containing so I'm sorry I should say carbs recognition and it's a taking a picture

401
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:55,360
I'm just making an example if that then is published and there are reports the support the beneficial

402
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:00,720
to patient then the ADA role is to say let's look at the literature so we can do with this to make the

403
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:08,000
patient's life easier you mentioned that you've been doing this for at least 25 years and you said that you've

404
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:17,520
seen cgm grow and become so integral in treatment if the last 25 years of your careers indication of where we may

405
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:28,320
go in the next 10 to 25 years how are you feeling about the future of diabetes treatment and technology

406
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:35,520
so I really see in the birth of technology and the development has been so fantastic to see so many changes

407
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:43,280
I'm thinking about the patient most of all how to make this tool easy to use for people with diabetes of any age

408
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,200
you know that's very important we're seeing people with diabetes age beautifully because the survive

409
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:56,240
56 years with diabetes can they still use this system can we make him sample for them to use can we allow them to

410
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:03,200
use when they're getting older so are they smaller do they require more dexterity or less dexterity can

411
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:10,560
they be more automated without they need for intervention so I see as I've seen this moving along the hopefully

412
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:17,360
the decrease of the burden of the person with diabetes in their daily life if you were things to think about

413
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:23,840
if you were buttons to push if you were thoughts about having diabetes because the technology is taking

414
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:30,240
care of that component yeah well you can sign me up for that gratia thank you so much for coming

415
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:37,760
on the show this was such a cool view into a side of diabetes that I never really knew about and it's

416
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:44,240
cool to hear about all of the work that's going on to make this information about treatment and

417
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:52,000
education more accessible to the physicians that then can help you know patients like me so it's very

418
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:00,640
cool I so happy that you invited me to be part of your your podcast and I follow you too so

419
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:07,680
they I'm going to describe to you anyway amazing amazing awesome well thank you so much thank you so much again

420
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,960
what are your thoughts on the standards of care is there something that you believe should be on there that
