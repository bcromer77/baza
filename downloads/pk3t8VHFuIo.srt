1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
I have to level with you.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,840
The Samsung booth at CES was massive.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,960
It came in around 50,000 square feet, so this video won't be covering everything.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,080
Instead, let's keep on track with the future of smart homes from Samsung, which they have

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,680
redubbed intelligent homes.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:26,480
Here I have Jason with Samsung.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,480
What do we have back here?

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,480
What's up guys?

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,759
Right behind me, we're taking a look at Samsung's new lifestyle TV called the Sero.

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,400
Now we have the ability to connect a mobile device to our TV, and if we're watching a video

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,360
that may be better viewed in a landscape mode versus a portrait mode, I have the ability

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,800
to rotate my phone and then have my TV rotate along with it.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,640
This is expected to launch later in 2020, and do you have any on display that we could

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
try out maybe?

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
We do.

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,080
We have a really cool display right behind me right here, and then behind that we've got

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,240
a couple more individual modular stations that we can go check out.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,680
With the Sero, your friends will no longer be able to shame you for not filming an portrait mode.

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,720
At present, the automatic rotate function is only compatible with Galaxy devices.

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,560
Apple and others will need the Sero app to control the TV.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,520
But think of the TikTok potential.

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,839
Oh, are you on TikTok?

23
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:14,839
Same.

24
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:18,080
It's just an underscored tech underscored talk, obviously.

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,080
That's flipping awesome.

26
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,679
Right back here, we have Rubin and Batschev giving off an awesome presentation, but this is all

27
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:27,080
conceptual, right?

28
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,280
This is conceptual, the Batschev is an AI-based kitchen assistant.

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,000
It can help you do everything from understanding what you're asking it or what you would like

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,720
to make, and it can access the database of what you have in the house in terms of inventory

31
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
of food.

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,880
They can do simple physical actions like setting the stove up and getting a pan out of

33
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,640
a drawer, and then it can help you prep what it is you want to make, whether it's cutting up

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,920
your produce or prepping the meats that you want to cook, like they say, everybody can use

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,039
extra set of hands in the kitchen, and that's what Batschev has.

36
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,640
Personally, I don't need that much help in the kitchen.

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,720
Here that voice, she cooks, but I could always use more intelligence.

38
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,880
Can you tell me a little bit about what an intelligent home is?

39
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,040
Yeah, so Samsung, we've been talking about the multi-device experience for quite some time.

40
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,040
It's a device that can act over a network, and they have the ability to communicate with

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
one another.

42
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,600
There are 150 different partners, Samsung is working with unsmarting certified devices.

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,920
This could be your Samsung TV and mobile device to certain manufacturers, thermostats, or door locks,

44
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,800
windowshades, everything else that could be in the house that could connect to one another, and

45
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,200
you can control from a simple device like your cell phone, or even your Samsung ULED TV.

46
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,960
Now for one of the coolest announcements from Samsung, Bolly, can you tell me about Bolly?

47
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,600
We're just going to get more intelligent than with robot personal assistance, and robots

48
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,880
that are able to help make your lifestyle, or your health a little bit better.

49
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:55,120
Bolly is a little ball that has the ability to move around with you or in a particular space, and

50
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,200
it gives you feedback as to what's going on in the room or take commands from you.

51
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,440
It could be literally your personal assistant.

52
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,320
If you walk past an area where maybe your dog or your kids made a little bit of a mess on the floor,

53
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,079
you can call Bolly to come over and assess the situation, and then Bolly has the ability

54
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:14,320
to command other smart connected devices in your home, like maybe your Samsung robot back, and

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,000
it can say, oh, this is a simple dirt mess, robot back, and clean it up, and Bolly can do the work

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
for you.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,519
One is called Bot Air, which is a robotic air purifier.

58
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,040
Has the ability to move around, route a home, or a living space, and start filtering the air

59
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,359
until it deems it to be more breathable, or to a healthier spec.

60
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,240
And so are these also concepts, both of them?

61
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,080
These are both concepts, yes, whether or not we'll see them in 2020 is yet to be determined,

62
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,760
but I sure hope so, because they're pretty awesome.

63
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,760
Are you impressed?

64
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,760
Same time.

65
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,920
For more CES coverage, make sure you subscribe to this channel right down there, give it a like if you enjoyed

66
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,920
it.

67
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,920
I'm Justin, and I'll take you later.

68
00:03:50,920 --> 00:04:00,920
Can I help you enjoy it?

69
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,920
No?

70
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,920
Same song.

71
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
Same song.

72
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
Same song.

73
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
Same song.

74
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,920
Same song.

75
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
Same song.

76
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
Same song.

77
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,920
Same song.

78
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
You're not addressing the song.

79
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Okay.

80
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Same song.
