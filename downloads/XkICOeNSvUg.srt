1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So, a few months ago, I showed you this awesome VR music experience, and I had to come out with more.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So, prepared to be amazed by Red Pill VR.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Imagine if Coachella, the Sims and Virtual Reality, were all morphed together.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's what you get with Red Pill VR.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Red Pill VR allowed visitors to enter an interactive electric garden dance club in virtual reality.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We are essentially building the future of social music experiences.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We believe that music is one of the most driving things that brings people together.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So, we invented a technology that allows for infinite scalability for an artist to be able to reach a larger fanbase than just the number of tickets that's torn at a door.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We're creating worlds and environments in which artists can perform

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and connect to their fanbase.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And we as consumers of the music, can have these social experiences with our friends

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
from different cities all over the world, sharing this experience together.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm about to jump into Red Pill VR.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to be transported into a club dancing with the other people here.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The DJ is going to be there.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The dancer over there is going to be there.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let's go clubbing.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It was time for me to join the party.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So I threw on an Oculus Rift S and a subpack and entered the club.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The inside was a real DJ playing music and a giant sized dancer.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Both are at the booths with me injected into the game.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The dancer was wearing body trackers to fully encapsulate her movements.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Red Pill VR has invented a technology that allows them to take a stereo signal of sound

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and break it down to its core components and apply the audio to react to objects in the club.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So you may notice that a mushroom is beating to the bass or a flurry in the air is moving to the keyboard.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I could interact with the world and dance with other people.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hey, Tina.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I even walked up a spiral staircase and I shrunk in size as I went up.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Are you seeing this on the TV right now?

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm getting small.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm like an owl.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This is literally Alice in Wonderland right now.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Then I teleported to the VIP section where I was literally standing on the DJ's desk.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Isaiah says this is just the beginning.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Right now, it's a location-based solution.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
In other words, what you see here?

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We will show up and create and do as an immersive event experience.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So that's our sort of phase one launch.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But ultimately Red Pill is a platform.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You as an artist can come in to our platform, build your nightclub, or your venue, or your space.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Invite your friends to come here you play.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Terri virtual ticket, or have a subscription, or make it free, or make it sponsor.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And show your music with the world.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You're a attractive team, huh?

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
To sexual assault count if it's in a video game.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Sorry.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Hey, I have a app.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
These are things that the government need to start thinking about now.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So what I was just told is that in the future,

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
they're going to start implementing the ability to push people away.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah, if someone comes up to you and they give you the worst pickup line,

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and then VR slap your butt, you can push them away and tell them to go.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
They go.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
themselves.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thank you so much.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I am in shock right now.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And there were so many possibilities.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I could get smaller.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I could go up an elevator.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I could see the entire club from a, like, this beautiful vantage point.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I was feeling the music.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And not to mention the first time there, I made it to the VIP section.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Red Pill VR is just the beginning.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
With Oculus coming out with Facebook horizon,

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I can't wait to see what other worlds I can visit and create in virtual reality.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There's the Aurora Ballet Ruralis.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There's the Northern Lights.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
How did this technology make you feel?

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Is this the beginning of Ready Player One?

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Tell me what you think in the comments.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Also, don't forget people.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's important to dance and real life too.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I am so incredibly excited about the future of this technology and the future of virtual reality.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If you want to be there on this journey with me,

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
subscribe to this channel and follow me on social media,

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
because it's going to be an amazing adventure.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Until next time, I'm Justin.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And I'm a techie later.

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
One last question.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What happens if you take the blue pill?

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You wake up and believe whatever you want to believe.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
All right. Well, thank you so much.
