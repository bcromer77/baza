1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
Oh my god, girls, I'm over here.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,600
Hi, come on over!

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,240
Girlfriend, it's so good to see you.

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,920
Oh my god, it's so great to meet you as well.

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,640
Jackie's told me so much about you.

6
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,640
The food is so good here.

7
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,480
And they have a salad bar.

8
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,520
Jackie told me you were diabetic.

9
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,680
I made sure this whole place was diabetic,

10
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,520
friendly.

11
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,360
I got to you, girl.

12
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,440
So do you think we should tell them she has diabetes,

13
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,840
so we can sit down faster?

14
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,320
Are you sure you can have that?

15
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,520
They have pasta, too.

16
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,800
You're having the bullies.

17
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,560
Girl, you mean the bull nays?

18
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,480
I can't read either.

19
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,760
She'll have the pasta.

20
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,600
Hold on.

21
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,760
You need whatever you want.

22
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,560
Lucky?

23
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,560
Oh my god, does that make you the good diabetic?

24
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,040
Oh, person with diabetes.

25
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,880
Oh my god, that's so cute.

26
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,560
I love that.

27
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,240
Wait, did I just become an ally?

28
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,640
Oh, so yummy.

29
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,760
Are you okay over there?

30
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,160
How are your levels?

31
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,200
Can we be so full of salad?

32
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,480
What was that?

33
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,960
You're low, insulin.

34
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,320
Does anyone have insulin?

35
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,160
Don't worry, guys.

36
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,160
I've used an epipen.

37
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,480
I'm not afraid to use it.

38
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,320
It's a lint.

39
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,600
We should be get some.

40
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,800
Oh, I don't know if they're going to have anything

41
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,040
without sugar, though.

42
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,640
We could go somewhere after for you.

43
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
I'm going to ask, hold on.

44
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,920
Hi, I'm here with a person with the good diabetes.

45
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,760
Do you have any good options for people like that?
