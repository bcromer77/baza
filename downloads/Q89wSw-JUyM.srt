00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
Hey guys, welcome to my channel, this is a very special episode because I am announcing that

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:12,320
I have partnered up with Magic Leap to create a series of six videos I am elated to be working

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,720
with such an awesome company that has the Magic Leap 1 Creator Edition. This is the headset

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,000
or Lightware's Magic Leap calls it. And this is the light pack, the computer powering the device.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,360
It is a spatial computing device that takes in your entire surroundings, tracks your hands,

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,360
your eye movement, where your eyes are focused. Today's episodes all about their brand new Spotify

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,640
app on this. Spotify is bringing music streaming to spatial computing. This is a first for Spotify,

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,000
and then this is also a first for Magic Leap having an app that can play music with their

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,960
background music service. So without further ado, let's take a hop, skip, and a Magic Leap

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,200
into this video.

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:02,560
So I got my main menu right here, and as you can see it's just levitating in my living room,

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,160
and I'm going to open up the Spotify app. So the first thing Spotify is going to have me do is

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:15,280
place it somewhere in my room. It wants to be on a surface on the ground. Once the app is placed, Spotify

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,360
comes alive in a life-size layout, right in your living space. On top you have your recently played songs,

15
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,240
playlists, and artists. In the middle is a cube-like Spotify player, and that the bottom are

16
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,400
stacks of recommendations. The app is intuitive and the controls are natural. At the bottom you can hold

17
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,280
the trigger and move the controller side to side to search through the stacks, kind of like looking at

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,280
records at a record store. The app allows users to curate and decorate their augmented reality with their

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,920
favorite playlists, songs, and artists. I'm using a Magic Leap account for copyright issues,

20
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,480
so this isn't the music I listen to. I'm going to take my editing jams, right? I'm going to hold

21
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,800
the trigger, and I'm going to put it right by my computer. There it is right there. On the wall by my

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,680
editing station, and then it gives me the options to delete it, or I can play it. So let's play it.

23
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,840
And there it is. The music is playing right from the speakers right here.

24
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:19,120
And then if I want to pause it, there we go. Pause it. And there it is in the main player.

25
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,840
Okay, so I'm going to decorate my apartment a little more with my recently played. I got a dinner party

26
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:34,720
playlist right here. I'm going to put that right on this wall. As I placed the playlist around my apartment,

27
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,440
I felt like I was in a Spotify playground. Watching the artwork navigate my walls as I moved

28
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,840
them around was a true testament to how precise the room tracking is on the headset.

29
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,079
The music art also acts as your own art pieces. I could see myself creating some abstract collages.

30
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,440
By default, the playlist are these four square images, but if you go on to Spotify through the

31
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,040
computer, you can change them to any image you want. Love that for me. So now that I've decorated my

32
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,160
living room in my kitchen, I'm going to take this to the bedroom. I was impressed by how smooth and seamless

33
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,359
it was to move this Spotify player to another room. Next, I placed some artists above my bed,

34
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:17,280
so I could have some smooth jams to serenade me before bed. Artist tiles resemble vinyl records,

35
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,000
so you can save that trip to the record store and throw up some Spotify art. The cube-like

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,079
player is aesthetically pleasing as it rotates between songs. I never imagined I'd be Spotify running in

37
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:34,960
such a tangible way. So if you want a little more control over Spotify, you can use your phone to

38
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,600
control it. Right now I have the app open. You see right there, it's connected to the magically

39
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,040
over Bluetooth. Now that it's connected, I'm going to press play. And look, I've played my song.

40
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,800
In landscape mode, you can access the overtrapped, which allows you to control Spotify using the

41
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,640
background music service. The music will pause once you open up an immersive app.

42
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,120
Once you leave the immersive app, the music will start up again.

43
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:09,440
All right, so now I want to show you how you can have different apps open in landscape mode

44
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,600
and still have the music playing. Right here I have my overtrapped, I opened up a bunch of windows. I had my

45
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:21,120
YouTube video playing, Google open, and a gallery piece on the counter. The music would sometimes

46
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,080
be spotty and that's probably because I was working it really hard. I'm sure this will get better with

47
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,479
time. So this is really exciting. The fact that we now have the ability to have apps playing music

48
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,719
and then we can have them run in the background with overtrapped and the background music service.

49
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:41,919
And this spotify app really is just the beginning of what this technology's going to be. I mean, think

50
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,080
about it. You can put your podcast that you listen to every morning you cook breakfast, sitting in

51
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,640
staying in your kitchen and just click it and then it starts playing as you're cooking. If there's an

52
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,560
audio book you're reading, it could be in your bedroom on the wall when you're going to go to bed,

53
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,360
you click it and then it starts reading your book. Maybe even a corner of your home that you like to

54
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:06,480
meditate in can have some really nice ambient sounds. I mean, the potential is incredible and I can

55
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:13,520
not wait to see where this technology goes. Stay tuned for a bunch of videos coming out on magic leap.

56
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,760
I cannot wait to explore this innovative headset more and I have so much in store, just you wait.

57
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,400
So make sure you subscribe right down there, hit the bell for alerts for more. And also if you guys

58
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,600
found this video helpful, you should like it because that will help other people find it. I'm just in,

59
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,960
and I'll take you later.

60
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,640
Okay. Enough fun. Back to work, Justin.
