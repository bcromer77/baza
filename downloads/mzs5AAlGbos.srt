00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
Hey everyone, it's Justin, and if you're anything like me, you have no idea what to get your mom this year for Mother's Day.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:14,000
Well, if you want your mom to be a little more tech savvy and have an awesome new device, you may want something for my Mother's Day tech gift guide.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Here it is.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
First gift is the Satachi CD slot, it goes into any CD slot, and then you can mount your phone right in this.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Listen, my mom, see sometimes text and drives, or she picks up her phone to try and call me.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No, you're not doing that anymore. We're going to put this in your car, and then you know what we're going to do for you.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We're going to teach you how to use Siri. You can say, hey Siri, call Justin.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hey Siri, text Justin, thank you so much for the gift, I love it.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And also, if they have an Apple music subscription, hey Siri, place them on Dreyabuchelli.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Saving lives, not texting and driving, and also your mom's learning how to use Siri.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I love it.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The second gift is something that I find really intriguing, but I never actually use myself, and it's portal from Facebook.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now, portal is this type of tablet with a camera that's meant for keeping people connected through video chats.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What's so cool about these is that it's a stationary tablet with a camera that tracks you.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So you can literally place this tablet down, be doing your laundry, be cooking, walking around an entire room, and it will follow you.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So you don't have to hold your phone the whole time, you don't have to be out of frame, it's really, really neat.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
On top of that, there's also Alexa built in, as well as other apps, like Spotify, CNN, and a ton of other ones that you can,

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
actually use as a tablet and go through those apps.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So there are two models for the portal.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
There's the portal and the portal plus.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,000
They're normally $200 and $350, but right now they're $100 off each, so it's either $99 or $249, and that's ending on May 12.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So make sure if you want to get this, you get it before then.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Again, I don't have the portal.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I can't fully be like, this is amazing. I used it, but I think it's really intriguing, and it's something that I'm considering getting my mom is here.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I help my mom isn't watching this.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So the next device is a smart home device, and it's really easy to use.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It is the Philips Hue light switch dimmer. It's super simple. It comes with a light bulb and a dimmer switch.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's great for parents that, you know, in the middle of the night, they want to just run and use the bathroom.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
They just click this little remote, that they could put right by their bed, and it turns light on and off, and also dims it.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If you want to go even a little further with that, you can look at the Philips Hue family, get that smart hub, and then also get some other light bulbs,

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and then your mom will be able to use her Alexa, Google home, or Siri in order to turn those on.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
They're great device, and you could always add on other smart home devices as well.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The next one is another gift I got my mom, and she loves it, and it is the NYX Play Wi-Fi picture frame.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You set up an account for the frame, and then what you're given is an email address that you can then email photos to the frame.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Literally, if I'm like on vacation with my friends, and I want to send a picture to my mom saying hi, I just take that picture,

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and email to my mom at NYX Play.com.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I mean, that's not the email, she has a name, but I'm not giving out her personal email.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't want you guys sending dirty pics to her frame.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And not only can you send pictures, but you can also send little messages, so I can send her a picture that's like,

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and also put Happy Mother's Day.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The NYX Play frame started $140 and go all the way up to like $200.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm happy with $140 when I got for my mom. It works just great.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
My final gift is like, super, super easy to do, and I've actually done it before, hallmark e-cards.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
On this website, you can go through a bunch of different cards that are sent to people over email,

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and they have videos, beautiful music, beautiful images, and you just kind of personalize it, and then you can send it off.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's just a really easy way to send your mom a card, but also they're really powerful sometimes.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Like, I sent my mom one last year, and she legitimately texted me saying, I bought it.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's $5 for a month, or you can pay for an entire year, and it's only $1.75 a month for the year.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I mean, think about it. If you're going to get a card every three months, even, you're still paying less than if you go to CDS.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Those are all the tech gifts I have for you right now. If you have any for me, please let me know in the comments below.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I want to know what tech gifts you are getting your mom, and teaching your moms how to use.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm going to have all the links below again.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Subscribe to my Instagram, my Facebook, my YouTube, I'm constantly putting out material.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That way you guys can stay informed on discounts, and fun tech, and things for your mom, and stuff like that.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
As always, I'm Justin, and I'll take you later.
