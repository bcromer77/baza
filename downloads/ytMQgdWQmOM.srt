00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today, I am in Burbank at Jet Suite X where I'm about to, for the first time, fly on a semi-private jet,

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
fly over to San Francisco. Let's check it out.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Jet Suite X is a private air service that sells public charter tickets at competitive prices,

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and I was so ready to try it out, so I walked inside and waited on a short line to check it.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The process only took a few minutes, and I was done. Besides the lady swapping my bag for the clock,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
there was no security. I got to keep my comfortable, but stylus shields on the entire time.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It was slightly unsettling, but at the same time it don't so right, so I have my ticket right here. There is a slight delay, but you know what?

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I don't care because they have a lot of natural sunlight, and that is really the key to my heart.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So let's chill in the lounge, or in the hangar, and see what this place is all about.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The Jet Suite hanger had fused ball, cornhole, and couches for people to spread out, and there were rooms with tables and chairs for getting work done.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, in my favorite part, there were snacks, so obviously I chose my space, ate the business woman special, and connected to the free Wi-Fi.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The plainlanded right outside the hanger, and the arrivals descended the stairs, grabbing their luggage.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The cleaning process happened so quickly, I didn't even realize my flights started boarding.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I was so busy filming, and apparently everyone else had boarded, that I had to run almost 100 feet and board the plane.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I mean, I was in my seat in a minute, but I was winded it.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The one and two seat layout was new to me. There were only 30 people on the flight.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The seats were simple, spacious, had great lag room, and refined. There was no entertainment system, but it wasn't really missed on such a short flight.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
After the standard safety instructions, we were in the air, and it was smooth sailing.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh, except for the fact that the bathroom is out of service, luckily they told us this before we boarded the plane.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
There was one flight attendant who came around and asked for drink orders, and to my surprise, alcohol was included.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
She came around with a variety of snacks including waffles and pretzels.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I was impressed with the service, and the flight attendant seemed peppy.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's probably because we were all living our best luxury lives.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Once we landed, I was off the plane in the jiffy.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh my god, that was awesome!

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Jet sweet X! That was great!

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I've got to say, flying jet sweet X was a very cool travel experience.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The fact that I could arrive to the terminal only 30 minutes before my flight was unreal,

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and the laid-back hanger with very few passengers was a refreshing change from typical airports.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's just not talk about my carbon footprint.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Jet sweet X offers flights in these cities, starting as low as $59 each way.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And also, you can redeem your tickets for Jet Blue True Blue miles.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
At the end of my trip, I was lucky enough to fly back from Oakland to Burbank, and I was even more impressed.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, and I also ordered delivery to the terminal.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So I just ordered door dash that's what one of the employees recommended I use, because I was hungry,

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and I thought to get my food, and then pick it into the lobby area, and now down before I get on the plane.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Wow! Jet sweet X was definitely the sweetest way I've ever flown before.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
