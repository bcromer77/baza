00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Welcome to the channel. I'm Justin. I have tight one diabetes in on here. I talked all things diabetes tech news and research and today we are talking all things tandem mobile.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I have never used a tube pump before and this was my chance to try it and I wanted to see what it was like to go from a tubeless pump to a tube pump.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Check out the algorithm and I'm going to get into that in a lot more today.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you're new, I've got socials at Diabet underscore tech and a blog where I write about the latest announcements in diabetes technology and a newsletter that goes out twice a month.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There are links to all of that in the show notes. I have been using tandem mobile for about two months now. Look, it is a tube pump. It is my first tube pump.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I have been using OmniPod ever since I started using a pump. I was just diagnosed four years ago and I used OmniPod a tubeless pump for the last three plus years of my journey.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
tandem mobile is the smallest tube hybrid closed loop pump in the United States. It is such a tiny little pump. There's no screen on it.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's completely controlled with a phone and I knew I really wanted to try out this pump for a few reasons.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
One, I've never worn a tube pump before so I wanted to see what that was like.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And two, I heard that the algorithm for the pump was very strong. Pretty aggressive and good at keeping you in range, more often.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So I wanted to try that out. In general, this year I want to try out as many insulin pumps as I can, so stay tuned for that by subscribing.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
tandem has a 90 day return policy on their pumps. So I knew that when I tried this pump I didn't have to hold on to it.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
If it didn't work for me, I haven't quite decided whether or not I'm going to keep it.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But today is all about my transition from a tubeless pump to a tube pump.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What it's been like wearing mobile so far and I have a review coming that's going to dive really deep into the pump and everything from the algorithm that app.

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
How I'm working out with it and using all the modes.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And I've already put out a bunch of content on mobile. I did a site change video that's on YouTube.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You can watch me kind of walk through the entire site change process and I've got a bunch of videos on social as well.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And a podcast episode with a diabetes educator who walks me through the algorithm and I ask him all of my burning questions about it and how to use it.

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
In today's video, I'm going to get into what it was like transitioning from a tubeless pump to a tube pump.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What wearing a tube pump has been like in all aspects of life from the shower to using the bathroom and swimming.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'll talk about packing it and the pieces that you need in order to use it.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Plus, I'll get into all the different accessories that come with it in different ways to wear it, including using this accessory from sugar medical who is the sponsor today's video.

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
They make a bunch of different accessories from bags for packing small ones for the day.

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Big ones for traveling for a long period of time, which I've been using with my digital nomad moment.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Different accessories like this like clips for the tandem pod covers for omnipot.

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They have so many things and I'll get into that later.

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
There will be a full on review of this pump that comes next.

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So if you have any questions after watching this, drop them in the comments and I'll be sure to answer those in the full review.

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
All right, let's get into it.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So why did I decide to try out movie?

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I want to speak all of the languages that all of you do.

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
All of the different pumps in the CGMs and the way to do that is to try out all the systems.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And that is why I decided to try and movie.

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's got the same algorithm as the T slim tandem's other pump.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So I'm kind of getting an experience of both of those systems with this one.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And yeah, they had a 90 day return policy.

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I knew that it wouldn't hurt just to try it out.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And look at how small that is.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's a little baby.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I've never worn a tube pump and I've got a lot to say about that transition.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's weird after three years of using a tubeless pump to just start trying a new form of device.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That is completely different in so many ways and it's been quite the experience.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There also was an update to the algorithm to control IQ plus which brought a bunch of new features like extended bulls and temp basil,

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
which I'll talk about a little bit today, but I'm going to more so get into that in the review.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And also we spoke about that on the podcast episode with the diabetes educator.

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So let's talk about all the different pieces that go into the tandem movie.

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So for a site change, the pieces you'll need are a cartridge.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This holds up to 200 units of insulin.

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And then you've got infusion sets.

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
They come in two different lengths, 23 inches or five inches.

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And packing I found for movie is a little more confusing because not only do you need the cartridge,

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
but then you need to decide what lengths you want to bring of these.

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So for this vacation I'm here or it's a workstation.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm living in Brazil for a month.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I decided to bring about half 23 inches, half five inches.

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The scary part about that is what if I wanted more of one and I didn't bring it.

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I mean that's kind of just what you're dealing with.

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But I'm so used to just having to bring one little package from the pod.

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Look at how simple that is.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's all I need, whereas I feel like so much more can go wrong with not only just the cartridge,

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
then you've got the infusion set.

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Then you've got all of the adhesive patches if you wind up wanting to bring these,

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
then you've got the clip, then you've got the charger.

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And then you've got the cable for the charger.

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There's a lot that can go wrong with this.

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
In fact, I'm the type of person that I bring everything and then I forget the insulin.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So odds are that I will forget something in here.

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But thanks to Sugar Medical, I have a bag that I've been using to pack all of my diabetes supplies.

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I can go in there and count and have compartments that are all meant for the specific piece.

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Specific pieces that I know I need, and I know that I won't forget anything thanks to that bag.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And here's a little bit more about Sugar Medical's products.

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Sugar Medical has become my go-to place for diabetes accessories.

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Whether it's a travel bag or convenient accessories for my diabetes supplies.

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Here's some of my favorites.

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is the insulated travel bag.

77
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I have been using this bag for all of my month-long trips during my digital nomad moment.

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It holds all of my pumps and CGM applicators.

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There are compartments for alcohol swabs, insulin pens, needles, and the bag is insulated with pockets for ice packs.

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So I know my supplies can stay at the right temperature.

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There's also the insulated convertible supply bag, which is perfect for a day-out.

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The bag has a spot for all of my glue cometer supplies, and a place to drop in used strips.

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And you can wear it like a fanny pack.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Sugar Medical has bags of all different sizes.

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I've also been loving their pump accessories, including these pump pops for omnipod.

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That clip right on.

87
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
There's also the tandem moby easy to charge clip.

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This solves one of the major issues with tandem's clip.

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
With this one, you can charge the moby in the clip and then pick it up when you're ready.

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You can get 10% off Sugar Medical's website today with my code Diabetic10.

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I've also thrown links to some of the products I talked about today in the show notes.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Now, back to the episode.

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Let's talk about charging.

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is the charging pad for the tandem moby.

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Get the pump out and you just place it right on there, and then it charges.

96
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Now, it has been an adjustment remembering that I have to charge my pump.

97
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And not only remembering, but getting alerts that I need to charge my pump.

98
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's a whole new alert category that I never had to get before.

99
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And so there's been times where I'm laying in bed, and I have my pump charging next to me.

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And I just feel super tethered to not always just the pump.

101
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But two things I need to do with the pump, like charging it.

102
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The pump lasts about four to five days on a single charge.

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But I try to re-up it whenever possible when I'm showering, when I take it off to shower, and things like that.

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So I haven't been in this situation, but I thought, like, what if I forgot this charger?

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And I was at 40%.

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
How terrible would that be?

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And think about trying to find a charger.

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,000
If you're in a foreign country, or you're just, like, on a flight, the fact that your device could theoretically die while on a plane.

109
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And you can't charge it.

110
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I don't love that.

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Like, you know, with a device like Omni-Potter-Same Atlantic, which uses batteries, you can just replace those.

112
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But a pump that relies on wireless charging, maybe not as easily.

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's just another area of diabetes that you need to think about.

114
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And at least I'm actively trying to remove diabetes from my mind.

115
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So having to charge my pump, like I have to charge my phone, is just another added thing I've never had to deal with.

116
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What do you think about the whole charging wirelessly with pumps in general?

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Let me know in the comments.

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I know beta bionics is also like that.

119
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Are you using pumps like this? Do you have any problems with it?

120
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I want to hear from you.

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Now let's talk about kind of the difference between a tube pump and a tubeless pump.

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So this is Omni-Pot.

123
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It is, it's the only tubeless pump in the US right now, although tandem's working on a tubeless pump.

124
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Metronic is beta bionics is, I mean, so many of the companies are working on tubeless pumps.

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So I guess they seem to like this form factor.

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
In fact, tandem's even working on a movie that is tubeless itself.

127
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So with this device, you kind of just have it on you.

128
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And you can swim with it. You can shower with it. You can do all these things with it.

129
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
With mobi, while it is water resistant and can be under water for about an hour,

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
it is not advised that you swim with it that you bath with it that you shower with it.

131
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I have shower and bathed with it before, but more often than not,

132
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I want to be naked in these things.

133
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I was wearing the adhesive sleeve in those situations and it got a little wet and that was fine.

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But this new situation that I'm in of needing to disconnect from my pump,

135
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
every time I do these things, has been a bit of an adjustment.

136
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And not just that, the only way to suspend insulin with mobi is by going to your phone,

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
going into the app, unlocking it with days ID, tapping suspend insulin and then there you go.

138
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You did it.

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So I'm finding myself all the time in the bathroom, getting ready for the shower,

140
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
then all of a sudden I have to run in the other room, go to my phone, turn off insulin,

141
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
take off my pump, put it down, maybe charge it.

142
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Something I never had to do with a tubeless pump, and I don't love that part of this system.

143
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And I don't mind as much the tube, surprisingly.

144
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I thought I would care about having a tube on me.

145
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I kind of just hide that in my clothes or my swimsuit, whatever, and I'm fine.

146
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But the whole disconnecting and reconnecting has been a bit annoying.

147
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's also when I go to the bathroom specifically sitting on the toilet,

148
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and when I pull down my pants, and there's a tube hanging out, and sometimes it's pulling.

149
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And I don't like that.

150
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And I also was changing my clothes for the gym, and I ripped out the infusion site.

151
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That was the first time I ever did that.

152
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's just all of these areas that I never had to think about, like, I have diabetes.

153
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I've had to confront my diabetes a lot with this pump.

154
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Now of course, the upside of this pump is the ability to disconnect.

155
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And that's why a lot of people like it.

156
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Once you disconnect, you have this small little piece, probably the size of a dexcomg7 on your body,

157
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
that is much smaller than on me pod.

158
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But I will say when I was wearing on me pod, I never felt the need.

159
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I loved it naked shower, but I never felt this need of, like, this is so annoying.

160
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I wish I could take it off and then put it back on during showers,

161
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
although that would actually be nice.

162
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But what I've gotten in return with Moby, I think the annoyance of having to suspend insulin,

163
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and all those using my phone in the other room, and then put it down, and then go get it,

164
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and then put it back in, and then forget to start insulin.

165
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
All of that is a bit more of a hindrance than having an omnipod somewhere at my body.

166
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Now here's what would make that a lot more simple.

167
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Is having a suspend insulin button on Moby, and Moby does have a button on it right there.

168
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And I'm going to tell you what that is, but that button could be used to suspend insulin.

169
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Like if it was a certain pattern you had to do in order to suspend and then start up again,

170
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I mean, that would just be phenomenal.

171
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And remove all of that annoyance I have every time I take it off.

172
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Now what this is is a quick, boldest button.

173
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So from this button, I can tap it, and then tell it how many carbs I'm eating or how much insulin I want.

174
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I have it set to carbs.

175
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I have it set to increments of 15 carbs.

176
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You can do three of those increments, so up to 45 grams of carbs, 15, 30, 45.

177
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And let me tell you, this bowl of this button is freaking awesome.

178
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And what I like about it is your phone could be somewhere completely at the other end of your home.

179
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
There's no Bluetooth needed for this.

180
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's all within the pump, and the pump is, you know, connected directly to a continued glucose monitor.

181
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
One of the added bonuses by using tandem as your tube pump is the ability to adhere to your body with.

182
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
These adhesive sleeves, that tandem cells.

183
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Unfortunately, they don't come with the pump. You have to buy them separately.

184
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I think it's 25 dollars for a pack of 10, which I wish that they included them, but they don't.

185
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And so that's what it looks like.

186
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It works very well. Like you can keep this on.

187
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You can keep this adhesive patch on for nine days and keep moving your sights.

188
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I just don't love the look of it, especially compared to an omnipot.

189
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's a little more medical looking.

190
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's kind of just like not the nicest piece to have on my body.

191
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And I found myself after using this twice, not wanting to use it again.

192
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It is very convenient if you're running a marathon or you're a runner and you want to be able to have this, you know, completely unclipped from you and detached and just at here on your body somewhere.

193
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
There is a place in a time for it, but I found that I haven't needed it.

194
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I have opted more so to go with their clip and just clip it on my on my pants or put it in my pocket.

195
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And of course, using sugar medical's clip that just goes in here and the best part is like I said earlier, you could just charge that through there and then you're all set.

196
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I think I would be more likely to wear an adhesive patch if it was prettier.

197
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And there is the collido pump and I actually got my hands on collido adhesive patches, which are these diamond shaped adhesives that you put directly on the back of the pump.

198
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And then you put another piece on your skin.

199
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's like Velcro and you just push it on and then it's super sleek looking.

200
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I actually used those on the mobile and I loved the way it looked.

201
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So I'm hoping that tandem creates other adhesives that they offer to their users or that other companies that do work on mobile accessories that they see this video.

202
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And you guys can come out with these adhesive patches that I think would just like look way better with mobile.

203
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So this video was not a review of the pump.

204
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The pump is a fantastic system that's going to work so well for many people and for me it's worked well.

205
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's just been a huge adjustment and it felt like I needed to make a video about this switch from tubeless to tubed.

206
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And the fact that I needed to confront my diabetes more than I have in years.

207
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Not only has my diabetes been front and center in my eyes when I'm showering when I'm using the bathroom when I'm needing to charge it laying in bed.

208
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
When I'm worrying about charging it things like that.

209
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's more in other people's faces when I'm wearing a speedo at the beach and I have this big tube coming down or if I use the adhesive patch and then you've got a big tube or even just a small tube but this huge machine.

210
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Omni pod while it's not much different in size than then mobile, it does feel cuter.

211
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And it has been something that I wear with pride.

212
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And sure, mobile is something that I would wear with pride.

213
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But it's just been difficult for me to get used to all of these pieces coming off of my body,

214
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
whether it be in my everyday life or just around people.

215
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What are your thoughts with the looks and styles between Omni pod and tandem, mobile, wearing those, have you switched from one to the other and felt a certain way?

216
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Let me know in the comments.

217
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Of course, there's so much more to these systems than just the looks.

218
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
There's algorithm. There are features. There are activity modes and sleep modes.

219
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Things that are for some people, so much more important having all of those abilities.

220
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'll get more into the nitty-gritty of everything and review tandem mobile for how incredible it is and then drawbacks and features I want to see in the review. Don't worry.

221
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
In that review, I will get into the algorithm and the app.

222
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'll get into what it was like going surfing, like what I did surfing. I'll go deeper into modes, whether it be activity mode or sleep mode, how I've been using those.

223
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'll get into all of the different alerts that I've been getting used to with this device that it vibrates and beeps for different reasons and how I've worked out with the device.

224
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The mechanisms that I've put in place in order to have a successful workout not have to eat a bunch of carbs after I worked out which is the worst.

225
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Let me know your thoughts on today's video.

226
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Toobless. Are you on a team? Let me know in the comments. Do you switch from one to the other?

227
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I want to hear from you. This has been such a learning experience and I'm excited to be putting out more content on mobile.

228
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And we'll see. Am I going to give it back at the end of the 90 days?

229
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I don't know yet.

230
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But what I do know is, even if I hold on to it, I could still get omnipoblet I want to because that's pharmacy benefits.

231
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
At least in the U.S. I don't know how it works elsewhere.

232
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Anyway, thanks for watching. I'm Justin and I'll take you later.
