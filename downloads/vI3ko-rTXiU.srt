00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
Hey guys, today I'm at AT&T to check out the Magic Leap 1 Creator Edition.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,600
So this is basically a spatial awareness technology.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,600
They're not calling it VR or AR because it can do both.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,760
They're starting to throw them into some AT&T stores around the country and luckily I live

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,760
right by one.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,880
So let's go check it out.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:28,080
So I am here to try out the Dead Mustai, a Magic Leap experience by Game of Thrones and HBO

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,280
and I'm pretty f***ing f***ing f***ing.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,680
And I'm really pumped, so let's go do it.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,680
Here is everyone.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,800
It's the Magic Leap 1.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,400
I am so ready to put this on.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,840
Let's go for it.

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,840
Wow.

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,200
All right, so I'm going to jump on in.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,640
The Dead Mustai, a Magic Leap encounter.

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
Now loading.

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,000
That's what I see over you right now.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,840
I hear there's a white walker in it that I get to kill.

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
All right.

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,320
I'm going to look this way and there's a ring I have to look at and it's freezing.

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,240
All right, okay, now it wants to be going this way.

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,240
There it is.

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,280
It's all the way over there.

25
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,520
Move closer to the ring.

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,520
Okay.

27
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,520
Hopefully I can.

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,520
Okay, there we go.

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,720
I'll point it here, preferred wall and press trigger.

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,720
Okay, here it goes.

31
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,720
I think this is like the big one.

32
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,600
So I'm choosing this wall right now.

33
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,840
It knows there's a wall there.

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,840
That's really cool.

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,840
Grab the dagger.

36
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
Okay.

37
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,920
I don't think that was supposed to happen.

38
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,520
This is definitely the Valerian Steel dagger that RIA used and I'm about to go grab it.

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:44,120
Okay, I have a dagger and it is snowing now and there's ice on the wall.

40
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,480
That is heartbreaking.

41
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,120
Okay, and it's coming toward me.

42
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:55,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no you didn't.

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

44
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,580
There's a white walker.

45
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,600
Yeah, yeah.

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,040
Holy, oh, he just died.

47
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,039
I killed him.

48
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,900
Well, I just killed a white walker and I feel really productive about the day, so I think it's

49
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,520
time to go.

50
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,020
As I was leaving, I bumped into Tim Johnson, the VP of Sales at Magic League.

51
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,400
He explained everything about the device and what it's capable of.

52
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,880
There are four world cameras, basically, or recording everything you see.

53
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,680
There are depth sensors and all kinds of other sensors that are basically making sure that

54
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,320
they can measure the space and know how you're moving through it.

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,200
There are two eye tracking cameras that are basically watching what you're looking at.

56
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,360
Obviously, with your eyes, you can also get biomarkers, so obviously, long-term you wouldn't

57
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,080
log into this, you put it on, it would recognize that it was you, and then it would work.

58
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,840
Otherwise, it wouldn't work for anybody else if that's what you decided.

59
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,880
We can tell a lot about your health, your heart rate, your cholesterol levels, all of those

60
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,640
kinds of things we can tell from your eyes, so it's pretty amazing what it can do.

61
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,440
There is so much more to this interview, and I was thoroughly impressed, so I'm coming

62
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,440
out with a video next Thursday with more.

63
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,840
So, subscribe to my channel and make sure you click the bell to get alerts.

64
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,720
In that video, I'll have this full interview, and I'll play a bunch of games.

65
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,720
So stay tuned.

66
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,440
There's a hologram of C3PO right now, talking to me.

67
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
There's corgs.

68
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,440
There you go.

69
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,200
Oh my goodness, that was unbelievable.

70
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,560
This is unlike any device I've ever used.

71
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,400
It's not VR or AR, it's a spatial awareness computer.

72
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,840
It does so much more than any other device I've tried.

73
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,760
The Magic Leaf One is $2300, so I know it's not for everyone out there, but you have to check

74
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
it out.

75
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,280
Go to one of your AT&T stores right now, it's only at five stores in these cities below, but they

76
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,560
are going to be rolling it out around the country throughout 2019.

77
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,960
So definitely keep an eye on what stores it's available at, because you need to try this.

78
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,840
I've got some other tech videos to do, so until then, follow me on Instagram, Facebook,

79
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,160
subscribe to my channel.

80
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,800
Yes, I'm talking to you before you close out of this browser, subscribe.

81
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,680
Anyway, I'm Justin, and I'll take you later.
