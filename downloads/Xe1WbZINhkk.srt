00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Hey everyone, welcome to my third installment of the Magic Leap series.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,520
Over the last few years we've been bombarded by technology that pushes us past the 2D screen,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,000
and with this new check has come lots of new terms with lots of differences.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,600
Today I've partnered up with Magic Leap to explain what spatial computing is,

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,000
how it differs from the others, and show you some awesome software taking advantage of it.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,560
So without further ado, time to get spatial.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:35,360
Let's start with the basics, virtual reality, or VR. If you follow my channel then you probably

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,920
know a little bit about VR. Oh, you don't follow my channel. How embarrassing? Well,

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,160
you know you can fix that by clicking that button right down there and clicking the bell for alerts.

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,680
VR allows for complete immersion that takes us out of our normal reality and you guessed it

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,000
of virtual one. There's the VR heads and on max, on zeros, strap around his head, but

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,800
max can't see he's in a completely different universe. The fully immersive environment of VR is great

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,840
when the goal is to escape. It's why you see devices such as the Oculus Quest or experiences like

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,320
the void shine in environments that take you out of the real world. But of course despite efforts

15
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,640
to prevent it, things like this can happen. There's someone here, um, so that is what Toby's

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:27,440
Oh, ho ho ho. Did you just need to watch my walls? Which leads me to augmented reality or AR?

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:34,480
AR keeps us in our physical world and augmented. AR devices come in lots of forms such as notifications on

18
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,400
your windshield or eyeglasses. You've probably even seen it with apps like Pokemon GO. These devices

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,920
simply overlay content onto the physical world. They don't understand or interact with your surroundings.

20
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,640
and this leads me to spatial computing.

21
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,080
Spatial computing augments your reality but goes a hugely

22
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,680
further to understand your space and allow the content

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,240
it's projecting to interact with your surroundings,

24
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,280
essentially merging the digital world with the physical.

25
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,800
So when I'm opening up apps and placing them around my space,

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,960
they will bang against furniture and naturally sit on top of surfaces.

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,520
They'll also stay where they're placed in the room.

28
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,280
Projections will also hide behind walls, fixtures, and furniture.

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,520
The best way to explain spatial computing is to show it.

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,560
For this, I will show you an experience that really highlights

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,720
what makes spatial computing different boosters.

32
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,040
Boosters is a rocket-plying game from Leta Workshop.

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,800
All you have to do is fly the rocket around the room and collect asteroid

34
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,800
gobbins on the way. The rocket interacts with your physical environment,

35
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,200
so as you steer it close to walls and furniture, the heat reverberates off of them.

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,240
And when I steer the rocket too close to objects in the room,

37
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,360
the rocket explodes.

38
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,600
When placing the launch pad down, the headset displays a mesh

39
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,360
as it scans the room. But the game also measures in real time,

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,640
so as I walk through the lofty apartment, the rocket continues to fly

41
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,880
through previously unmatched areas.

42
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,920
theoretically, you can move from one side of a space like a show

43
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,960
room or a factory floor to the other end and the rocket will continue to interact

44
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,680
with your new surroundings. And when you land the rocket, it places this cute little flag.

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,720
Oh, that's awesome. I just put one right over there in that corner.

46
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,000
Spatial computing is also being put to work in a more productive way with things like

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,440
manifest from tactile. Manifest is being used as a way for employees to create and interact

48
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,880
with digital content that's overlaid onto physical objects.

49
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,640
Employees can use spatial computing content and devices to more safely

50
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,120
operate equipment, inspect and maintain it, or even undertake training on physical

51
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,160
equipment through digital training modules to check for tired damage, look for abrasions.

52
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,320
I could easily see this being used one day at home when I'm building a Kia furniture.

53
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,200
Magically, meet a Kia, a Kia, meet magically.

54
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,160
Another spatial computing app I love is create.

55
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,720
In create your building a world using characters, portals, building blocks, and more to build

56
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,240
an ecosystem to your liking. All the characters interact with your space and each other.

57
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,800
They'll even interact with you, like this cute little bot that needs my help getting off the couch.

58
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,960
There you go, little bot.

59
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,000
As I sit here with these T-rexes, nights, and astronauts, I can't help but think, you know,

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,960
that's where we are now, but one day these can be buildings, or cars, or even better yet,

61
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
roll a coaster Tycoon. Come on.

62
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,799
Spatial computing continues to fascinate me. In my opinion, this is the tech that will have the largest

63
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:41,760
impact on society and the general public. What excites you most about spatial computing?

64
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,840
Let me know in the comments. Okay, before I take you guys later, I have one more thing to show you.

65
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,760
Time for lift off. Three, two, one.

66
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:58,080
Now that we're headed to space, make sure you guys give a like to this video if you enjoyed it,

67
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,880
subscribe to the channel and click that bell for alerts. I'm Justin, and I'll take you later.
