1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
we call this our cell-pote technology and it literally is a poach and it's made from implantable

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:17,120
pliable surgical mesh. So what the physician does right now in our clinical trial is the physician

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:23,920
will surgically implant this beneath the skin of your abdomen but above the muscle fascia of your

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:31,520
abdomen then what happens your blood vessels grow around this they grow in it and they grow through it

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,520
so it literally turns into what we call a biohybrid organ but you can see these horizontal channels

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:45,200
there are plastic rods essentially so when this has become vascularized the surgeon will go into

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,840
under your skin again they will pull these rods out leaving these cylindrical cylinders into which

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,560
he will then or she will then impregnate this with functional eyelet cells. That's the technology

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:06,400
and we've been working on this for several years now and we are partly through the phase one

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,440
to clinical trial which means your evaluating principle is safety and also you're looking for efficacy

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,360
and the efficacy that we've been looking for is patients becoming insulin independent.
