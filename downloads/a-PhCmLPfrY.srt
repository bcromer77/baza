00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Hey everyone, I know that a lot of you right now in this weird time are setting up home offices

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,440
as am I actually, this is my setup right now, there is a lot that I can do and you guys can too,

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,000
and that is why I'm making this video. I'm going to tell you guys a bunch of different ways you can

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,080
make your home offices more comfortable and more productive. Now I also know Amazon is only sending out

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,200
essential products right now, so I'm going to be providing links in the description with places that

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,320
are still shipping products. All right, here we go.

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,440
First thing let's start with some tools that you'll want to have at your new home office,

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,000
mice, keyboards and some webcams, so the company that I truly love and this is not sponsored at

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,480
all is Logitech, so let me start with their mice. What I really like about Logitech,

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,680
mice is that they have Bluetooth connectivity and they also have the ability to switch between

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,120
three different devices. They also have a really nice feeling in your hand, a very nice build. The

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,360
more professional one is the MX Master 3, this one's really nice, I've used this and a few of my friends

13
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:14,080
have it and we all really love it. Then the other one is the MX anywhere to S. Well, I know you're not really

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,640
going anywhere, but you could in the future and this one's also really great. This one's a little smaller

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,320
but it has all the same functionality and it's 20 bucks cheaper. Next keyboard, so the one that I have

16
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,920
is the wireless solar keyboard K750. It's only 60 bucks and this one's really great because you can just

17
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,880
throw it in the sun and charge it up and it will last a really long time. The only downside is you need to

18
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,560
plug in a tiny USB receiver to your computer. I edit with it a lot and highly recommend that one. The other

19
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,280
one I would recommend is the MX Keys. This one's got Bluetooth. What I like about this over the solar

20
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,880
one is that it pays backlit. This keyboard lasts you 10 days or five months without using the backlight

21
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,280
and it's only $99. $30 cheaper than apples, which isn't even backlit. Lastly, for logic tech

22
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,440
devices, webcam. So I know a lot of us are using Zoom Google Hangout, things like that. I have the

23
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:12,640
HD one. This one was like 70 bucks but they also have some really high end ones. There's a 4k one called

24
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,720
the Brio Ultra HD Pro webcam and then there's also the Logitech Streamcam. This one's really built

25
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,760
for streaming like video games and things like that. It has a camera and a microphone attached to it.

26
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,280
But I know a lot of them are sold out on the website and I know this one is sold out. Next is sound.

27
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,080
So I know a lot of you are probably stuck at home working with your roommates and you're probably going

28
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,480
to want to block out some of the sound in your home. Here are a couple of options. The first one

29
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:47,440
are the AirPods Pro. Love these things. What's so great about them is that they have active noise

30
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,839
cancellation. I actually reviewed these and I'll put that video in the description. I am so happy with

31
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:58,799
these. The active noise cancellation is incredible especially for the size and what's so great about

32
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:03,120
these is that you could run with them. You could work out and then you could also use them in your home

33
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,840
office. You can also easily switch between your iPhone, iPad and Mac with these. You're not a

34
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,320
Mac user then maybe you should look at something else. So I have another option. The Bose noise canceling

35
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,760
headphones. They're obviously bigger than the AirPods Pro. Mine are this big. This is like a couple

36
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,400
years old. The newer ones are nice. The newer ones are also wireless. These are amazing on the plane

37
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,960
if we can go on one anytime soon. But they're also just really great. So if you don't mind something

38
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,400
a little bigger, go with the Bose noise canceling headphones. Next up, if you guys are using a laptop,

39
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,200
you definitely want to get a laptop stand. Right now if you're looking at your laptop, you're kind of

40
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,280
hunched over looking down. It's very low. So you're going to get hunched over. You're going to get bad

41
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,320
posture. So in order to fix that, you can get a laptop stand and you'll basically breathe bringing your

42
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,080
screen higher. Also while on that subject, I recommend having a second display. That way you have

43
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,840
more service area. When you're looking for second displays, you want to make sure you're getting

44
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,360
a refresh rate of about 120 Hertz. That's what I recommend. I'll throw a few of the recommendations

45
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,120
in the description. While on that subject, I made a video on how to use your iPad as a second display.

46
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,079
I'll throw that video in the description too. Okay, I got two more things for you. First is an iPad

47
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,360
keyboard. So if you guys are using an iPad or if you have one like around and you want just a lightweight

48
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,640
tool to use around your home, get the iPad keyboard. I just reviewed it. I reviewed a couple of

49
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:33,360
logistic keyboards and the Apple one. I highly recommend having a keyboard with your iPad. Also Apple

50
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,599
is introducing mouse support for your iPad. So just watch that video and then imagine also using a mouse.

51
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:45,440
It's going to be incredible. Okay, lastly, I don't have this here. I need it. It's a standing desk.

52
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,719
So I have a couple companies that people have recommended. My friend Toby who actually lives here. He has

53
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,640
the uplift and then another friend of mine has the fully. I'll put links to those right down there.

54
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:03,360
So price-wise, there are about the same. I'd say anywhere from like $5 to $700. They have basically

55
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,040
these really nice standing desks that you can personalize and have settings so that your number one is

56
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,960
for sitting number two is for standing number three is like somewhere in the middle and then also they have

57
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,240
things that you can put on top of your basic desk that you can just lift up and then it creates like a

58
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,560
standing situation. You can even make treadmills that you can put down there and walk so

59
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,320
those are options too. That's everything I have for you guys today. Please let me know if there's anything

60
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,280
that you guys have added to your home office in the comments below. I want everyone to get some ideas.

61
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,080
I want more ideas. Also, if you have any questions on anything that I brought up, let me know in the

62
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,480
comments. I'm here to help. We all need to get through this together. That's the only way we're going to do it.

63
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,200
I've got a lot more coming your way. Stay tuned for a smart home series coming in this house

64
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,039
and pump springs. Sponsored by Philips, you, oh my god, I'm so excited and I've got more magically

65
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:01,520
videos. AR really cool. Can't wait. How do you guys see these? Subscribe right down there. Click a like if you

66
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,440
enjoyed it. That's what I've got through now. I'm Justin. I'm not like a waiter.

67
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,120
I hope that the video looks okay. This is what it looks like. I'm a little like I'm a little oily. I really

68
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,960
like this, but whatever. It's like, do whatever I can.
