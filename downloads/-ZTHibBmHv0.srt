00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
Hey everyone, it's Justin and I am obsessed with my Oculus Quest and you're going to be also

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,400
So here are the top five things that you have to try as soon as you open up that box

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,040
First things first subscribe to this channel. I have a ton more VR content coming out

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,640
And you don't want to miss it also follow me on social media. I have a cute face and I smile a lot

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,440
You won't want to miss the smiles. Oh, and I have giveaways first thing

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,640
There are a ton of free demos that you can try on this thing right out of the box the first one

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:42,020
And you have to do it. It's beat saver. This game is literally DDR meets Star Wars because you're holding two light savers

8
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,980
And you're moving around to the beat of the music and you are going up down to the sides dodging these walls

9
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:55,100
It is so much freaking fun and sort of great work out. I definitely bought the full game and it is really really great

10
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,960
It's $30 so definitely check that out another demo that is awesome is the space pirate trainer

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,460
This is like a shooter where you're shooting a bunch of drones in the air and you can change your weapons on each gun

12
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,620
And it's really really cool. I also got that full game and you'll probably want to as well

13
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:17,120
And it's $15 and the other demo that I think you really have to try out is called sports scramble

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:25,280
And I like to call this we sports on steroids this game gave me that same feeling that we sports gave me the first time I tried my

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,520
We sports cram was basically a bunch of different sports

16
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:35,960
But scramble you're playing tennis with a ping pong racket or a crooked thing of a jigger or a baseball bat

17
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,320
Also, it's really cool about sports cram is you could play online with it

18
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,920
I will be coming out with more videos on all of these games so stay tuned for that

19
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,460
All right the second thing this one comes from you guys and it's definitely true

20
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,900
I just left it out of one of my videos and it is VR adult content

21
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,900
It's actually really cool and

22
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,780
Life like you can put this thing on and believe that you are in a real-life

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,840
Sexy trust me actually if you don't believe me watch my friend Toby tried out for the first time

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,480
Oh my god

25
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,360
Whoa

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,480
There is already a ton of VR adult content available on the browser

27
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,440
You just have to google it so put like VR blank porn and a ton will come up

28
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,080
Literally next you'll have to check out these video content on this thing

29
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,920
Oculus is definitely pushing for people to watch movies and TV shows

30
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,760
They've added a TV icon which takes you to a home theater that basically acts as a hub for all of your TV apps and

31
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,940
Displace all the shows you're watching. There's also YouTube VR. There are a ton of YouTube videos that are 360 videos

32
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,440
I watched this solar clips and I felt like I was flying. It was amazing. Okay

33
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,739
The next thing you have to try out are multiplayer games. The Oculus quest is all about

34
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,459
Multiplayer and being social surprisingly because you're putting something over your face and

35
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,019
Leaving this world. There's a built-in mic and you can talk to people

36
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,820
There are a bunch of multiplayer games already available on the quest which I definitely plan on examining in another video

37
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,860
But real quick here's some fun ones

38
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,820
I already mentioned it, but sports crambles a ton of fun online. There's also rack of fury

39
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:22,980
Which is a super fun table tennis game, which I'm gonna be doing a video on soon and also having a giveaway on so stay tuned for that

40
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:30,460
There's also some social media experiences like big screen where you literally socialize with people around the world in a virtual reality chat room

41
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,340
Here you can see I went to a screening of John Wick 2 with a few other people

42
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,420
It was surreal

43
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,860
Skyrim and chair like kind of feels like a primitive ready player one and I am gonna recommend one game

44
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,220
And that is a Vader immortal. It's a Star Wars game

45
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,300
And this is a really cool game because you're set into a Star Wars story

46
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:56,420
It's kind of short. It's about like a 30 minute game, which yeah is super short

47
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:01,900
But you also get these really cool dojo training levels that get really difficult

48
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,580
And you're using a lightsaber in the whole time and defeating drones and droids. It's a lot of fun

49
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,020
And you also unlock levels and lightsabers along the way

50
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:18,820
So those are the top five things you have to try, but there is so much more. So that's why I'm creating so much more content

51
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,920
Stay tuned for that by subscribe to this channel follow me on social media for giveaways and just

52
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,820
Me being a goof. Please comment below with anything that you think that I need to try out because I need some good ideas

53
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,940
I already have some, but I want some more

54
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,500
