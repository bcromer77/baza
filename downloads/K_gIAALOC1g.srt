00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Hey guys, welcome to my AirPods Pro Review.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,200
I am so excited to tell you guys about these.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,240
I got them for Christmas and I've got a lot to say.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,840
But first, if you guys enjoy this video, make sure you give it a like right down there.

there will be a link in the description below.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,640
Alright, without further ado, here's my AirPods Pro Review.

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,320
Hmm, it rhymed.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,000
The AirPods Pro are the latest earbuds coming from Apple,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,920
joining the original AirPods.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,640
The pros come with a super sleek wireless charging case that's incredibly enjoyable to open in

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,560
clothes, and are packing a much bigger punch than the OG AirPods.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,000
They have a shorter stem than the originals, but I can guarantee you they will still fling off your

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,600
ears when taking off your shirt.

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,320
And I still feel like an alien wearing them.

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,360
Unlike the originals, these are sweat and water resistant.

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,960
So they're great for anyone who wants to work out, or is it a heavy sweater?

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,440
And their main selling point, of course, is their active noise cancellation ability,

22
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,880
which I'll get into in just a bit.

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,400
They support soft silicone tips for a snug fit in your ear and come with three different sizes

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,680
for a customized fit.

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,960
There's a fit test right on the iPhone, which helps you find the perfect size for your ear.

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,760
Just go to Bluetooth, click the eye on AirPods Pro, and run the ear tip fit test.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,120
A lot of OG AirPods peeps say their AirPods easily get dirty with earwax.

28
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,960
First of all, gross. Second of all, I'm happy to report that with the AirPods Pro,

29
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,640
the silicone tips actually prevent wax from getting on the netting.

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,840
Yay! The AirPods Pro get about a total of 1.5 hours of one charge,

31
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,440
and up to 24 hours with multiple charges from their case.

32
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,440
Apple says after just about 5 minutes of charging, they should last you about an hour,

33
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,120
which is perfect for a cute workout.

34
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,640
While on that topic, I've got to say I don't feel entirely comfortable wearing these on a run.

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,639
I found that the AirPods on my left ear loosens up as I sweat, and I need to continually adjust it.

36
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,560
They haven't fallen out yet, but I'm not super confident that they'll stay in.

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,920
Casual walks in weightlifting haven't been an issue, and they're definitely more secure than the normal

38
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,680
AirPods. But I'm bummed, I wanted these to be my running earbuds.

39
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,680
The AirPods Pro have seamlessly worked themselves into my lifestyle.

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,440
If you're an Apple user like me, you'll experience the same thing.

41
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,200
Shooting? But this is great because this is helping me,

42
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,520
because I'm literally doing a little video on my AirPods Pro.

43
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,360
As soon as you open the case, you get a pop up on your iPhone, showing their battery life,

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,560
and they instantly connect. If they were last connected to my computer, they'll automatically connect to that.

45
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,960
Check out how seamless this is. Right now, I'm going to play the cut. I'm literally editing

46
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:57,840
this video right now, and when I take out the AirPods, the audio quickly starts playing from the speakers,

47
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,960
like instantly then put the AirPods Pro back in my ear, and it's playing in my ear already.

48
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,320
They obviously built with the Apple user in mind, so if you're not an Apple user, these may not be for you.

49
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,800
When you place the AirPods Pro into your ears, a pleasant ding goes off, letting you know they're

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,560
connected to a device and ready to play. It's pretty instantaneous and extremely satisfying.

51
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,480
One of my favorite features is that when you take an AirPods out of your ear,

52
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,000
the content pauses, and when you put it back in, it plays. So when you're ordering your coffee,

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,600
you won't miss a second of your podcast. The controls are pretty simple. A quick pinch on the

54
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,360
stem will pause and play your content. Two pinches will skip forward, and three pinches will skip backward.

55
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,360
If you hold down on the stem, a little ding will sound to indicate you've switched between

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,560
noise cancellation and transparency mode. I'll get into what these are, how they work, and just how

57
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,240
awesome they are, and just a bit. Don't worry. Like the original AirPods Pro, these have the Apple H1

58
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,680
chip. With this, you get some great abilities. First, you can talk to Siri, just say, hey Siri,

59
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,720
and ask whatever you'd like. This is also how you change the volume. It works seamlessly, but I wish

60
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,640
there was a way to control the volume right on the pods, because sometimes I'm in the middle of

61
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,040
a coffee shop, and I don't really want to be talking to her. A super cool functionality is sharing

62
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,480
music. You can share whatever's playing on your AirPods with one of their person who has a supported device.

63
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,960
This is a functionality I've been dreaming of for years now, and finally you can do it,

64
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,480
but I wish you can connect it to more devices. Hopefully in the future.

65
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,080
Now it's time for the nitty gritty. How it works? Let's start with the most important feature,

66
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,520
the active noise cancellation. Basically, how it works is there's an outward and inward facing

67
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,680
mic. Both are detecting unwanted noise inside and outside your ear, and canceling it out with anti-noise.

68
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,960
I don't know what anti-noise is, but it works. As someone who's used many noise canceling headphones,

69
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,159
I gotta say I am extremely impressed with the performance. I got these as a Christmas gift when I was

70
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:03,840
in New York, so naturally the first thing I had to do was try them out on the subway. In the past,

71
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,280
I've listened to music on the subway with my wired Apple headphones, and I could barely hear what I was

72
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,640
listening to. Let me tell you kids using the AirPods Pro on the subway was an air-credible experience.

73
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:23,360
They were the Apple of my ear. I liked them, okay? If you're in New Yorker, these are for you.

74
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,360
The next logical step was to try them out on a plane, right? But I was consumed by Delta's

75
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,080
incredible catalog of movies. I'm not a sponsor of Delta Airlines, but I would happily be one.

76
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,480
Hit me up, Delta. That I completely forgot to try them out. Also, while I'm on that subject,

77
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,520
if you want to use these AirPods Pro on and planes entertainment system, you'll need one of these blue

78
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,160
truth receivers to plug in. If you want to check that out, I put a link in the description below.

79
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,760
Anyway, I've used a noise cancellation at many loud coffee shops and while walking along busy streets,

80
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,600
and I could barely hear my surroundings. And as soon as I'm playing something,

81
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,120
everything disappears. Now, I understand this could be a little frightening,

82
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,000
completely shutting off yourself from the world. And that's why there's transparency mode.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,120
Like I said earlier, when you pinch and hold the stem, it will switch to transparency mode.

84
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,240
In this mode, the AirPods let outside sound in, so you can hear your surroundings. It basically

85
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,960
removes that stuff you're feeling you get within the ear buds and allows your ears to breathe.

86
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,840
It's hard to explain, but it's really comfortable. I find myself using this a lot when I'm

87
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,640
walking outside because someone could easily be trying to jump me. Like, for an on-the-spot

88
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:39,440
tech review, can a tech YouTuber get some privacy around here? Oh gosh! Let's talk about sound quality.

89
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:46,160
The sound quality is great, but it's not amazing. Like, you're not going to get the quality that you get with

90
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,840
say the power beats pro, or your Bose noise canceling headphones, but for the size and the noise

91
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,800
cancellation, it's exactly what I need. While using the AirPods, I've noticed an occasional

92
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,840
blip in the audio. Like, very occasional, not to the point where I want to return them, but, you know,

93
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,720
definitely, to a point where Apple needs to figure it out. And it goes like a little bit, come on Apple.

94
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:13,360
Let's figure this out. What is that? We interrupt this video for a major AirPods pro mic

95
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,360
performance update. We have Justin in the field. Justin, what do you have for us?

96
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,480
Thank you, Justin. Yes, I'm outside Alford's one of the most overrated coffee shops in Los Angeles,

97
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,440
where I'm testing out from microphones on the AirPods. I've got lots of cars over here. We've

98
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,200
got lots of people chatting it up. Right now, I'm recording the audio from the AirPods Pro to my voice

99
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,760
Reynolds app, and I just want to give you an example how the mics work. Back to you, Justin.

100
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,120
Thank you, Justin, for that important wireless update. Okay, cool.

101
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,320
So here's how I see it. Yeah, they're 250 bucks. And that may sound like a lot of

102
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:00,240
money, but the price actually makes sense. The headphones I normally use for noise cancellation are my

103
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:07,760
Bose noise-canceling headphones, and I love them. But those go for $400. They're great, but they aren't as

104
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:13,920
compact as the AirPods Pro. Of course, they have impeccable sound quality, but what I love about my

105
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,520
AirPods is how versatile they are. I can easily pop the case in my pocket or in my backpack and take them

106
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,440
anywhere. The space they take is incredibly small, and they're packing a punch. Bose also sells

107
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,640
noise-canceling earbuds, but they're not wireless and they're the same price. Now, I've tried a lot of

108
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:37,360
headphones and earbuds, and I can confidently say that I justify this price point. I'm going to give the

109
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,440
AirPods Pro 4.5 out of 5 stars. They are seamless additions to your Apple family and have some

110
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,840
fantastic features, like noise cancellation and transparency mode. If you have an iPhone,

111
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,240
these are the most logical earbuds for you. It's a huge bummer I can't wear them running,

112
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,600
but they fit in all other aspects of my lifestyle. I think there's definitely still room for improvement when

113
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,760
it comes to audio control, but the AirPods Pro's far outweigh the AirPods cons. And August,

114
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,360
Jolly G, I freaking love them. Sorry for the swears. Let me know if you guys have any questions about

115

these products in the comments below. Also, I'm considering doing a comparison video between the

116
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,640
AirPods Pro and the Power Beats Pro. If that's something you're interested in, also let me know
