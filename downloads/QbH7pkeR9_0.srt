00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hey Facebook, it's Justin. Good to see you again. So this thought came to me. Of course, it was on the dance floor where I get most of my good ideas.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I thought to myself, social media is preventing us from having conversations with ourselves.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And this is very true to me. I found myself waking up every morning, rolling over and the first thing I would do was go on Facebook.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And then I'd scroll and scroll and scroll and scroll. And I didn't really find myself gaining anything of importance.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I just found myself going on the app at a board on. And instead of using that valuable free time that I had to honestly sit and solace and think to myself or go sit down and edit a video, I just spent it on social media, which wasn't very productive.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
My timeline is full of like really sad news. And I'd kind of just see like everyone's opinion on things kind of like this video.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So I deleted the Facebook app four months ago. I didn't delete Facebook in general just the app and I do not miss it at all.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm not saying that social media is the devil and you need to get rid of all of it. I'm just saying that for me, it's really had a great effect on my productivity by deleting that Facebook app.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I think at the end of the day that spending a little less time on social media in general is a very very good decision for all of us.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I think spending more time with ourselves and also spending more time on that project that you've been postponing or hanging out with friends in real life.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I think that's always a little more fun than scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and scrolling.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If you kind of want to get a visual for how much time you are spending on these apps, if you have an iPhone, you can use this thing called screen time in the settings.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Just go to settings, scroll down and go to the search at top, put in screen time and then go to that and then you can take a look at all the time you're spending on all of your apps and see from a day or a week perspective.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You could also set limits on apps as well.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Personally, I find that just deleting the app going cold turkey is the way to go.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I've worked for smoking cigarettes too.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Weaning off cigarettes didn't work for me.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I had to cut them out.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes, I smoked cigarettes for like five years and it was gross.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But I've stopped smoking for eight years now and I've never felt better.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't smoke kids, which apps are sucking your time out of the day.

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Do you want to get rid of them or no?

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I definitely challenge you guys to try this out too if that's something that you're interested in.

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm not going to push this on you but I'm just telling you kind of how it affected me.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And I'm really, really happy about it.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I find it fascinating the amount of time we spend on social media.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How we use it and also how different generations use it.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So I think it's interesting and I'd love to hear your feedback.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I kind of have an idea of like interviewing a bunch of people about their habits.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
If you think that's a good idea for a video, let me know.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I think it could be fun.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So I hope you didn't scroll past this video.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I hope you watched it.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If you liked this video, give it a thumbs up.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you care even remotely about what I say, then you should subscribe.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And I think that this is a really good thing for people to keep in mind.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's like spend a little less time on social media and a little more time with yourself.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't know. Could be fun.

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I have some really cool videos coming out soon.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I have a review of the Facebook portal coming out.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So yeah, I deleted the Facebook app, but I introduced the Facebook portal into my home and I love it.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So stay tuned for that. That's coming out soon.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Other than that, I'm Justin, and I'll take you later.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Anyway, it's all I have for now.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I just kind of wanted to...

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Ooh, there's something like that.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I kind of just...

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Anyway, it's all I have.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Oh, it's still my eye.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Do I look like I was crying?

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I wasn't.
