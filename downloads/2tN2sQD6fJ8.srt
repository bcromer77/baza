00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,480
Hey guys, so it's a bit of a different video for my channel.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:18,400
I normally don't make videos that kind of show my personal side, I normally and just

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,400
very professional, telling you about some cool technology, whatever, and I love doing that.

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,200
I also really love that you guys have been on that journey with me.

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,360
I wanted to kind of catch up with you guys, tell you kind of some ways that I'm

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:40,160
socializing with friends and some technology I'm using that is just making each day a little more fun

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,920
or a little more social. So yeah, let's do it.

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,239
First and foremost, connecting with friends and family. The ways I've been doing that is I've been

9
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,239
doing a lot of face timing and I've also been using my portal TV. I love it because I'm able to put

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,000
all of my friends and family right on the big screen. They don't even have to have a portal TV,

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,879
as long as they have face book messenger or what's up and I chat with them and then the camera falls

12
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,600
me. So I really love that. I've been using that a lot. I can have up to six people up there and we're actually

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:17,120
going to have a party in my apartment later. Me and my roommate. We're having a long island mother dress up party.

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,560
I think it's happy and I think we all need to just find things that are fun to do inside that

15
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,360
make us happy and make us laugh. I think that's key. Laughing and making others laugh and happy.

16
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,080
I'm getting emotional. I'm going to have a Google Hangouts with a few of my friends. We're going to have a

17
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,840
happy hour tomorrow and we're going to play Quip Lash. Quip Lash is a great party game that you can play with

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,480
up to eight others. Everyone connects to the game with their phones. It's kind of like cards against

19
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,840
humanity, but it pits two people against each other for each question and is way better in my opinion.

20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,200
So here's how you can play over Google Hangouts. First you'll need to install steam by going to their

21
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,320
website, the links below. Once you download steam and create an account, you can buy the game.

22
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,440
Quip Lash is 10 bucks, but I recommend buying the party pack three because it comes with more games

23
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,600
and it's only $14 more. Next you'll need to invite everyone to a Google Hangout. So using a Gmail account

24
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,920
go to hangouts.google.com and from there start a video call. Then I suggest you copy that link and

25
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,200
send it to your friends. They could join in from their hangouts app on their computer or other devices,

26
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,640
but they will need their phone for the game. All right, last step, you as the owner of the game

27
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,760
will need to share your screen to everyone so they can watch the game in action. Right up in that corner.

28
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,400
Unfortunately, they won't be able to see you, but you can see everyone. And then it's time to play.

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,360
Have everyone go to jackbox.tv on their phones and to the four digit code and they're in the game.

30
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,760
Another thing, I can play on a lot of VR. I've been playing a lot of Star Trek Bridge Crew with

31
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,840
you can play with up to three other friends. This is a VR game, but what's really cool is if you have a PS4 or PC,

32
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,920
you can also join in. And I'm on this spaceship with three other people. We all have our different areas and

33
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,840
different jobs and we have to complete missions. It's been a lot of fun. Get that game right now. I love

34
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,120
VR so much. And I think that this is like a really incredible time for it. And then I think one of the most

35
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,880
important things having a schedule. What I do every morning, I make my coffee and then I go on a walk.

36
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:30,560
It's my morning routine and it just allows me to get excited for something. I literally like going

37
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,040
in bed at night, I'm excited to wake up in the morning so I can make my eyes coffee and go on a walk.

38
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,880
Something that's also been really helpful for me is using my Phillips Hue bulbs to set the lights

39
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:48,160
based off the day. So right now, you see that light right there, that set to a very light light.

40
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:55,760
It has like blue in it and it's the setting is energized. So right now I have it on energized, but

41
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:04,160
watch if I do this, the set of home lights to relax right there. That's what I'll do in the evening.

42
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:12,480
So I use the lighting around my home to tell my mental clock with time it is. Set home lights to

43
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,480
energize. I don't know how to set home to that set. Of course. The set living room lights to energize.

44
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:28,000
Sorry, I didn't find a device named living room lamp. I'll do that manually. There's energize right there.

45
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:36,240
Oh, okay. And now I'm trying to set it on my phone, but I put my phone on every play mode and took it off Wi-Fi so that

46
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,960
I wasn't distracted during this video. Anyway, that is what I've been doing. I still have a lot of cool products. I want to show

47
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,640
you guys. I'm going to be starting a pump spring smart home series. It's going to be like a six part series all about building the

48
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:55,040
coolest smart home top of the line gear and I think you guys are really going to love it. Also, what are you guys doing?

49
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,680
What is making you smile? What is making you laugh? Let's start a conversation for fun things that we

50
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:09,600
can all do. I think that it's more important than ever now to give each other ideas of fun things to do.

51
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,400
Anyway, we're going to be fine. We're going to get through this. Let's go to take some time.

52
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:24,240
And I hope that I can bring a little happiness to you during this time. And I hope you guys can

53
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,200
bring a little happiness to me. So I hope you guys enjoyed this video. I would love for you guys to share

54
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,680
to your friends and family. So they have these ideas. And I'm definitely going to be making more videos that
