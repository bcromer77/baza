00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,260
People don't know how to take one beautiful perfect great-head room great-lighting kind of picture and that's a really sad thing

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,720
So I went to Coachella and asked someone on the street. I'd be like, oh, you need me to take a picture really guys

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,960
They'd be like, oh sure, and I'll be like all right. Well now you gotta take a picture and we jump took a picture of them

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,120
I gave them the beautiful picture they get my camera and they take 15 pictures. Oh, oh

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,280
Don't that that that that that that they make a gift. I'm like listen

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,720
I didn't ask for a gift or a gift. I asked for a picture. We've gotten into this horrible

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,320
habit instead of taking one picture, we take a bajillion, 15 to be more accurate. Now my challenge

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,880
to you guys out there, if someone comes over to you and asks you for a picture, I want you to take

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,280
that camera, walk 10 feet away, roughly, make sure they found their light, maybe tap on their face

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,960
to make them pop and I want you to take a picture. Because you know what people, one picture can

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:01:00,960
speak a thousand words, but a thousand pictures sometimes doesn't even speak one word.
