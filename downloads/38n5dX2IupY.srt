00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey guys, I had to make a first impressions video of the Oculus Quest because this device is honestly mind-boggling to me.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's literally ready player one. It's the first untethered virtual reality device that you don't need a PC for.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So you're going to get virtual reality moving around having depth, perception, and spatial computing, right?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So I can create a play field in this entire room with this device because of these cameras right on here.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
There are four cameras right there and there, and those allow this to understand your surroundings and then allow you to move around.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So my goal is to at least have a few of my friends buy this device so that we can play online together.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There's a ton of multiplayer games and I'm feeling kind of lonely at the moment.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Something that's also really cool about this is that I can past what I'm seeing here to my phone or to a Chromecast onto a TV.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That way my friends who are hanging out with me can actually be a part of the experience now.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And it makes it a lot more fun. Also, what's really cool is just the way you create your play field.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So what I do is I put my headset on and I can actually see my surroundings because of these cameras and I actually draw a play field.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And then that's where I can play around and that's where it knows to show me walls.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So when I go to those outer limits, a wall up here and then I know to not go any further or I'll hit a wall like my friend Toby did the other day.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There's someone here, so that is what Toby is saying.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Did you just watch my walls?

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Did you hit it really that hard?

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I mean I hurt my finger.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh good.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I think good.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
At least it wasn't not, you know, my controller, right?

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So enough of me talking, why don't I show you a game?

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How about beat saber? I'll play the demo, I haven't bought the game yet, but I'm going to go with you.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And you should too.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Here it goes.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay, so first thing I have to do when I put this thing on is I have to create a guardian, right?

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I can still see my entire apartment look.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's my counter, this is my table.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Do you want to next sandwich?

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And now I'm going to draw my play area.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Beat saber demo.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm going to play demo level.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Here I go.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And this is a pretty easy level, but I can only imagine how hard it gets.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So I have to watch out for those walls.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And I have to do the blue ones with the blue ones in the direction that it shows me.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And the red ones with the red ones.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So I'm this one.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is actually I hear like a really good workout.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I want to, especially when it gets really intense, but it's, this is literally DDR.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Meet Star Wars in VR.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Now, because in the Oculus Quest you can play actual VR anywhere.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm like, I'm so impressed with this device.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And then there we go.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I can cross my swords and I can actually feel like a vibration.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
All right.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Just in.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let's see how I did this time.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
All right.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Now let's go to the last time.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm a little distracted.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That was just the demo.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's 29.99.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If you want the full game.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And I do want the full game.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And I'm going to get the full game.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I have a bunch more games that are really cool.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I have Vader immortal, which is who Star Wars experience created by I.L.M.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The X-Lab.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's actually the same company that did the Star Wars experience that I tried out at the void.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They created one for the Oculus Quest.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It really shows you the true potential of this device.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The graphics are amazing.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's a little short, but the fact that I can use a lightsaber and dual against robots is kind of amazing.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay, fine.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll play it for a hot second.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's do it.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Do lightsaber, dojo.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's my fingers.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So, there's mine.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
All right, here I go.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
These things are really annoying.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Ah.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh my god, I'm failing.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
All right, I've got to block this.

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Got him.

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Got him.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Got him.

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He's coming after me.

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Got him.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Got him.

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Got him.

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Shoot.

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Got him.

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is challenging.

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is like level eight, but I think it's like 45 levels or something.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
In this game.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Got him.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh, nope, maybe not.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Got him.

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh, shit.

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
All right, this dive.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So, that's just a quick tease into what the Oculus Quest can do.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Get one.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Or you know what?

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Subscribe to this channel so that you can see all the games that I'm going to be covering.

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm going to be covering multiplayer games, free things to do and all the things you have to try on this device.

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll also be having some giveaways for games on the Oculus Quest who definitely keep an eye on my Instagram and my Twitter for those contests.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Also, real quick, this one's the 128 gigabyte, which goes for $4.99.

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
There's also a 64 gigabyte set goes for $3.99.

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I definitely recommend going with the higher one if you have the money.

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You just want to try it out.

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Go for this smaller one.

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's fine.

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Quick tip what I did.

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You don't need headphones for this thing.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But I happen to have headphones where the cord actually detaches from the headphones.

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's a pair of bows.

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So what I did was I wrapped this right around here and then I have this click right into my headphones.

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And it's really convenient and easy.

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And then if I just want to use, you know, speak to the speakers, then I just attach it.

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That way my friends can hear it.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm going to go back to the virtual reality world.

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Actually, I have to go edit this video now.

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I barely been able to play this because I'm editing these videos for you.

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Anyway, I'm going to edit this video real quick and then I'm going to go back to the virtual reality world and make more videos.

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Until then, I'm Justin and I'll see you in the VR world.
