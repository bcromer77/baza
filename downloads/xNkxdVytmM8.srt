00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
In preparation for my review of the Philips Hue HD My Sync Fox coming next week, I thought

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,920
I'd go back and show you guys my interview with Philips Hue a few months ago, where

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,160
they showed off Hugh Sync on the computer.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,280
Yeah, so Hugh Sync is our entertainment package, so a lot of people don't realize this

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,840
with smart lighting, you can now actually have great interactions with all of your entertainment

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,440
music, movies, TV, video games, and we'll showcase some of that stuff now.

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:34,160
Hugh Sync is an app that runs on both Mac and Windows PCs, and syncs all of your

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,640
hue color capable lights with the content on your computer.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,520
It creates an immersive experience when you're playing games, listening to music, or

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,360
watching videos, and it works with any media you throw up on the screen.

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,360
Even me.

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,400
You can actually set it up to do a couple of different things in an rack, right?

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,560
So you have full control of your lighting, so your normal hue scenes, right?

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,840
Your read, your relaxed, I can adjust the intensity, I can turn my lights on and off, so

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,400
you have that functionality, and then of course, you can have some fun with colors.

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,680
The controls are simple, sleek, and easy to use.

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,000
First, I checked out gaming.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,400
So now you can see, as I move around, and as I rotate in real time, the lights are actually

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
interacting with what's going on the screen, and it's really bringing that immersive experience

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
out.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,840
So you can actually see, so as it starts to flash because my health is getting low, the lights

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,200
are actually flashing, giving me that anxiety that I'm actually dying over here, and then

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,400
that's great demo to show, right?

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,240
As I'm just as I'm dead, then he should off music.

25
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,280
So I'll turn on something like Pandora, and then what it's doing is it's picking up the music

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,400
and the intensity and the beat and the actual genre of music, and then it's now going to mix

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,400
the music that's going along with that.

28
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,120
So you'll notice as the music gets louder, the lights will get more intense, as the music

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,080
kind of dims down and gets more relaxed, and you can have some fun with some preset scenes,

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,360
so if you really want to have different color palettes, you can pick and choose, and then

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,960
set the intensity as well.

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,800
So if you didn't want it as intense, you just wanted more kind of gradual light changes, you

33
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,680
can do moderate all the way up to that.

34
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,400
Again, that full and tense where it's on and off on the beat of the music.

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,280
Then he showed me a concert on YouTube.

36
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,040
So the light setting is going on, and you're getting your lights are interacting in real time,

37
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,320
what's going on in the screen, and you can pick whatever you want, your lights are going

38
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,480
to interact.

39
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,760
So whatever, whatever's on your PC, that's kind of what's going on there.

40
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,040
Hucing is free to download on your Mac or PC, but you will need a bridge and some lights to

41
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,040
get started.

42
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,280
Everything is running off of the huge bridge, still.

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,120
And realistically, Hucing can work with any of your headlights.

44
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,680
We're showcasing here, of course, our full color range of lights, and then two products that

45
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,920
are designed specifically for kind of entertainment in mind.

46
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,079
So we have our Hucines, which is our table lamp.

47
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,880
We have a table version and a floor version, and then we have our Hucines, which are actually

48
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,160
mounted on the back of the monitor.

49
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,360
So they're really mounted here, and then the idea is to give that ambiance around the wall

50
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,720
and to kind of create that big splash effect.

51
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,840
Philips Hue has also teamed up with Razer to make the PC gaming experience even more immersive,

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,640
with Razer Chroma.

53
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,000
Unlike Hucing, which basically takes what's on the screen, Razer Chroma allows video game

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,080
developers to program lighting effects within their code.

55
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,960
And so you can kind of see that just level of integration that you can do.

56
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,160
And this, again, fully up to the game designer for whatever whatever they want to do with it.

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,280
So as you get, like, some of the combos, as you land the big combos, the lights will actually

58
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,840
flash and a rat, kind of give you that feel that you're really kind of there.

59
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,800
I played some mortal combat and was pulled into the game.

60
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,080
I'd say this is the closest you're going to get to VR without putting a headset on.

61
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,560
If you thought this was cool, wait until you see my review of the Philips Hue play HD MySyncBox

62
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,880
coming next week.

63
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,400
Philips Hue has brought the Hucing technology to our home entertainment system with this device.

64

Thank you so much.
