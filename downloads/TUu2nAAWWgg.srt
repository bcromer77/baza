00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
I am at AT&T Shape on the Warner Brothers Lops where AT&T is showing off their 5G network

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,720
and now it's going to completely revolutionize entertainment and our lives with its incredible

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,440
speeds. They have a lot of exhibits explaining their technology and how it's going to be used.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:29,840
So let's go check them out. AT&T Shape was packed with emerging tech. But what it all came

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,800
down to was AT&T's upcoming 5G network, which will completely change the way we understand

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,800
and interact with technology. This new internet tech will not only allow us to transfer data

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,640
at unbelievable speeds, it will also cut latency to allow for faster reactions. 5G will be

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,840
about 10 milliseconds, average latency time. Your 4G network right now around 100 milliseconds.

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,240
It's always like a tenfold improvement. The demo behind us had a motor working to keep a

10
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,040
pendulum balance over the 5G network. There was a sensor at the base of the stick reading

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,080
its angle and over the network the motor quickly decided how to move to keep it balanced. This was

12
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,680
all happening at about 8 milliseconds latency. Now if you pull the lever back, go ahead and pull it all

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,520
the way back, that's going to artificially increase the latency and you can see the thing can barely

14
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,679
stay stabilized. If it was 35 milliseconds, it would follow. So how is this going to affect you?

15
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:32,560
Well think about it when an autonomous car is driving 60 miles per hour. It will need this short

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,280
latency in order to react quickly. Also streaming capabilities of VR and AR content will be greatly

17
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,800
increased. Over wireless networks you could never do that for anything other than 5G. And this is actual

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:51,360
like an actual 5G network that's doing this. It's not a doctor's demo. We've really set up a 5G

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,880
network here that's going to get access. Not yet, it's it. Yeah, I don't. I don't think that's

20
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,560
given out the world up for the password for that one. Next I went to 18T's StoryBee to experience

21
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:10,000
the 5G network for myself. 5G StoryBee, what is that? We've basically taken a volumetric 3D capture station

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,240
where participants can walk in there and get their cells captured while telling their story. And that

23
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,080
content is a 3D volumetric content which gets processed in real time. You get sent over the 5G

24
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,600
network which the tablets are able to access and download this hundreds of megabytes of content.

25
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:34,160
Traditionally this type of interaction took minutes. Over 18T's 5G network, that interaction

26
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:41,120
is happening in matter of seconds. Okay so now I'm going to go watch myself as a small little person

27
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,720
in augmented reality. Let's check it out. Oh my goodness, look at me. I'm so small. Oh my god,

28
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,440
there I am. I'm fine. It's with this type of technology. Having a 3D volumetric phone call with your

29
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,360
love when I cross the country across the continent is in near future. You can see this and have a

30
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,920
transcontinental conversation with your loved ones with just super sense cameras and the power of 5G

31
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,960
with low latency and high better. Has Obi-Wan Kenobi come today at all or if you want Kenobi

32
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:19,680
has been reference tens of fines and I'm sure yet the hologram Luke has been reference more than that.

33
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,880
18T's 5G network is available in 19 cities across the US and it's slowly rolling out to more. Unfortunately

34
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,520
there's no data now for my hometown of Los Angeles. 18T's shape has shaped out to be an awesome event

35
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,680
18T's 5G network cannot get your soon enough. So pump for it. If you want some more details on their

36
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,640
5G network I'm going to throw it in the description below. Subscribe to the channel for more tech news
