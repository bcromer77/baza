1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Now I'm last day.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,800
I'm at the Philp Q Suite at the area at CES and they have a bunch of products and new features

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,800
to show off today.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,840
You know, I'm feeling pretty zen, it's time to get intense.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:24,520
Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,240
First let's start with one of my favorite Philips Q products and that is the Hugh Syncbox.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,120
Right back here I have the Maleficent trailer playing and now you can control the Syncbox

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,760
with a remote through infrared.

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,120
So there it is playing and I'm going to press the button right on this remote.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,440
While the Syncbox is going, I didn't have to take out my phone and turn it on.

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,440
Look at that.

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,640
You can also use voice commands to control it.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,840
So I'm going to switch this now to the Xbox using my voice.

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,520
OK Google switch Hugh Sync to Xbox.

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,120
Sure switching into a Xbox on the Syncbox.

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,120
Thanks girl.

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,920
There you go my Xbox is on and I'm ready to gain.

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,120
OK my mom said I've been playing too much Xbox so she wants me to play outside.

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,720
Welcome to the Philips Hugh Garden.

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,320
Let me show you some of the new outdoor lighting they have for us.

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,120
So right over here we have the up here.

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,720
This has a really nice light coming from both ends creating like a triangle shape.

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
Love these?

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,720
They track.

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,520
We have the e-connect.

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,520
These are a pathway lighting solution.

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,520
These also go really well with the sconces that they sell.

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,520
The e-connect.

29
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,520
They're iconic.

30
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,520
And this is the Lily XL.

31
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,120
Over there we have the Lily Spot.

32
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,120
That's been around for a little bit and this one I'm really excited to throw it at the smart

33
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
home in Palm Springs.

34
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,920
I'm building and we're going to shoot it up on a big palm tree.

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,120
And right over here we have the Resonate and I'd say they resonate with me.

36
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,120
Oh yes yes there's more.

37
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,720
Philips Hugh for a while now has had a 40 watt power supply but they're introducing a 100 watt

38
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
supply.

39
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,520
That means you can connect not just five lights but 12 now.

40
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,120
Your outdoor lighting is going to be ever more larger.

41
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,720
Philips has also introduced the ability to control zones with your Hugh accessories.

42
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,120
Now you can connect your accessories to lights all around your home no matter the room.

43
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,600
And this one I'm most excited about so up until now Philips has had Resonate lighting

44
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,600
in light but guess what now they're making in color.

45
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:30,799
This just makes me want to go like that.

46
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:35,400
A lot of great announcements today I cannot wait to get my hands on these products and when I do

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,600
you will be the first ones to know about it.

48
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,519
I also have a lot more for Hugh to be excited about this week so make sure you subscribe right

49
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:43,519
down there.

50
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,519
Give it a like if you enjoyed it.

51
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,519
I'm Justin and I'll take you later.

52
00:02:48,799 --> 00:03:03,799
The future right over here these are called the Resonate and Resonate with me.

53
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:06,600
I've been a one take man all week this is my wife.

54
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,799
Just a nap.
