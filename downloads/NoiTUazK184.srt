1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Oh, well, hello there, you two, come on in, come on in. Welcome to my smart home.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Any product I'm gonna point out in this video will be in the bio. One of the main devices

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that is power in my smart home is one you probably have heard of and its name is Alexa.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And I whisper that because she's very sensitive, she sits right there. Basically, I tell her what I want her to do.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And she does it. And she has no feelings for feelings never get hurt.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Right over here is my happy smiley face neon light.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I connected it to a leviton smart plug right down here.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And I programmed that to connect to my wing device.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And my wing device then talks to Alexa.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I could say Alexa, turn off neon.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And then I can go Alexa, turn on neon.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And there you go. You can connect any appliance to it and it will work.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So if you have like an air conditioning unit in your apartment and you want the air to turn on before you come home,

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
you can log on to your wing app and actually turn on the air conditioner remotely.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Other than that, I have few and life effects.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
They both have their pros and cons.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I have another video that you can totally check out basically weighing which one you should buy.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Right over here, I have a life effects light.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And then I have my few light strips over here.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The cool thing about the few light strips is that right on my phone,

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
it connects to the apple home.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And I have my kitchen lights right here where I can slide up and down the brightness.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And I can also go to color and choose different colors.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Cute light strips. They're kind of expensive.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But you get these really great lights.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And I also can talk to Siri.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hey Siri, change the kitchen lights to green.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And Siri does it.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So that's pretty cool.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I also have these few lights up here.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
All of these are connected to my smart home as well.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So what I can do is I can connect that smart outlet over there with my life effects lights

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and my few lights and they can all connect to my phone.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And I can do this.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Alexa, turn off home lights.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And of course, it didn't turn off my living room light.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But I mean with technology, there's always issues.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The light effects bulbs are very temperamental and I've started to transition to you myself

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
because they're just more consistent and reliable.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The cool thing about this is that I've connected my Logitech Harmony remote with my receiver

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and then that all connects to my Amazon Alexa.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So I can do things like, oops, she's already ready for me to say something.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Alexa, turn on Apple TV.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And then what she's going to do is she's going to talk to the Logitech remote

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
which will turn on my receiver.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Turns on the Apple TV.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And it will also turn on the TV.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And then there you go.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This is my Apple TV and three, two, one.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Alexa, turn on the speakers.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And then she's going to play the whatever's.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, she'll play whatever was last on my phone.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And I did not do that on purpose.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No, I did it.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I had an Alexa out there and I also have an echo in here.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I need to whisper.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Echo turn on bedroom lights.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There's my bedroom lights.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So I have two life ex bulbs right in those lamps.

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And then down here, I have more LED lights.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The great thing about these lights are there only $18.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And I made them smart lights by connecting them to the same kind of outlet

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
that I had out there the Levitton outlet.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So for 35 bucks plus 18, I have a smart light.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And then they also have this cute little remote right here that I can change

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
the colors.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I do have to get down because the sensors down there.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Well, I hope you liked the tour of my smart home.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If you have any questions about the gadgets or want me to do a specific video on any of the gadgets in general,

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I can do that because I can literally talk about these things for hours.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh, well, hello there YouTube.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Come on to my new smart home.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I just moved to it's my second smart home.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
This video is all about remote to buttons and switches around my smart home

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
that you can get to make your life way easier

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and way smarter.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
A lot of people out there are saying, why do you need Alexa?

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The reason is because I don't want to move.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But if I'm okay with moving or if I have a remote with me, then I'll use that.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I will have all of the links to these products, the best deals I've found in the bio

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
down below.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So let's come right over here to my power station.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So what we have right here is you may not recognize it, but this is a light switch.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We do not touch these.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
In fact, I should put some tape over those.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What we do use though is this right here.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And this is the Phillips Hue like dimmer switch.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This thing is so, so great.

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This alone is $25, but you can also get it for $35 with the light bulb.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I can control up to 10 light bulbs just with this.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm turning them on, off, dimming them.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Great device and super cheap for what it does.

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And if you're in the Phillips Hue family, this is like a no-brainer.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I would probably have five of these if I had more queue lights around my house.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Or bigger house.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
One day YouTube one day.

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The device that I just got and I am in love with is the Logitech Hop.

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And actually put the bell crow on it.

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That way I can kind of pop it off, put a tentet.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
For the starter pack, it's $57.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The starter pack includes the bridge for the device.

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And to just get a button, it's $40.

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
As a smart home, liver and builder and creator.

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm always looking for a device that connects all of my smart devices.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And this is it.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I can either tap it once.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Tap it twice or do a long tap.

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Give me three different abilities.

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
If I tap it once, it turns on all my lights.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If I do a long press, it turns on the art mode.

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What that does is it completely transforms my entire apartment.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It turns off my light lights into color light bulb.

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Also, right over here, I have my neon smiley face.

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That turns on with the we most smart outlet.

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It sets my living room lights and my kitchen lights to dim.

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And it turns on music.

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And so whenever I'm going to have friends over,

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I just long press that.

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I actually haven't had many friends over since I've gotten that device soon.

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I will.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So when I have friends and then when I have those friends over,

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm going to put party mode on.

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
One day, you two, one day.

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
All I have to do to turn this off.

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So that's party mode, and I freaking love it.

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This next device is one of my favorite devices.

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It is the Logitech Harmony Remote.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And what I love about it so much is that it controls my complete entertainment system.

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
As well as all of my lights, it has a few different buttons right here that control my Apple TV,

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
my Nintendo Switch, my speakers.

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So if I want to watch a movie on Apple TV, all I do is press this movie button right here.

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And it turns on my receiver, turns on my Apple TV, and it will turn on my TV.

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And then I can watch a movie.

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Then if I want to turn it off, I just click this off button and it turns everything off.

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I can change the light set if I want.

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So this light right here, it's connected to this.

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So if I don't want that on, it gets turned off.

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If I do want it on, but I want it dim it a little bit and just dim it down right there.

143
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And then I can turn this light off because it's a little too bright for the movie.

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm going to turn my kitchen light off too.

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And then that one.

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And then that one.

147
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And then another light bulb.

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And then we go to the club.

149
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And then we go out.

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And another one.

151
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The Logitech Harmony Remote.

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It is so worth it.

153
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If you have a system or set up that will fully utilize its potential.

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's sleep, light, and really comfortable in your hands.

155
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Who doesn't like something that's comfortable in your hands?

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Next.

157
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So.

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's way right there.

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So welcome to my bedroom.

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The one and only just a tech bedroom.

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Come on.

162
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You have this brand new pop button that I showed you over there.

163
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But this is the gray version.

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
If I tap it once, it will turn my lights on.

165
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I want to get things done.

166
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Some spring cleaning, summer cleaning, winter cleaning.

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I could double tap it.

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And it goes into like bootlighting when I want to get things done.

169
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And then I can hold it down.

170
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And it's a nice little night like late night.

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Then I go switch.

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's like late night pillow talk or just like late night nighttime.

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Get out of here.

174
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So there's your teas in switches, remotes, and buttons around a smart home.

175
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What basically I've done so far.

176
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
