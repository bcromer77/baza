00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Hey guys, today I am at Tubit Circus in downtown Los Angeles.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,520
It's basically the Stavenbusters, means virtual reality meets the circus kind of place.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,520
What is that?

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,360
Why don't we go inside to find out?

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,360
Actually, one second, something just doesn't feel right.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:24,720
Whoa, there we go, Tubit Circus, let's do this.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,560
Tubit Circus is a micro amusement park.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,760
This place is almost the size of a football field and is broken up into lots of different

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,760
zones.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,440
They have VR arenas, comedy shows, a midway circus, story rooms, which are their

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,920
own take on escape rooms and a loaded arcade.

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,640
Many of the games here are made by indie developers, so you won't find them anywhere else.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,160
Besides the games, they have a restaurant with some great food and an awesome bar with crafty

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,160
cocktails.

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,560
Oh, and a robot bartender.

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
Cheers!

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,560
I'm fantastic.

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,520
I guess you could say he has an eye for it.

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,320
Before I explore the premise, I wanted to know how this place got started.

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,200
So I talked to Brent Bushnell, the CEO of Tubit Circus.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,000
Fun fact, his dad is the owner of Atari.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,720
In 2008, we were pretty frustrated with fact that everybody was on their phones and on Facebook

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,160
and like basically home alone depressed.

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,480
And we thought that there was a really great opportunity to get people back together in public,

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,360
use a lot of new technology and also it's a fun stuff to get people playing together again.

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,640
So we just set up making interactive games, rooms, a laser beams, walls of buttons, stuff

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,240
we could just take to parties to get people having fun.

28
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,880
We did our own traveling carnival for two years before finally saying let's go permanent

29
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,160
and build this place.

30
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,680
This place is full of some of the most unique games you will ever see and lots of different

31
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
activities.

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,000
So, have they also have this?

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,360
Let's start with the circus.

34
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,800
So here is the midway and that is where you're getting that circus part of Tubit Circus.

35
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,920
Most of these games you see here are created by indie developers and you can't play these

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,080
anywhere else.

37
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,480
The midweek games were a lot of fun and unlike any carnival games I've ever played.

38
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,280
Most of them required you to play with others.

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,639
The things we make here are designed to create micro friendships.

40
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,600
Friendships that might just last for a second, they might get you to the bar, right?

41
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,880
They might last all night, they might be a new friend for life.

42
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,320
Tubit Circus is also jam packed with arcade games.

43
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,320
Just like the midweek games, a lot of these arcade games are made by indie developers.

44
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,760
One of my favorites was this DDR body movement game.

45
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,240
It was really, really neat.

46
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,640
Right behind me is the VR section of Tubit Circus.

47
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,000
They have a bunch of different games, multiplayer and single player and I'm going to play some.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,440
When you come here, make sure you set up a point for VR right away.

49
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,480
The time slots fill up quickly.

50
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,240
This section has a few VR arenas where you can play a bunch of different VR games.

51
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,240
I played Zombite multiplayer.

52
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,680
Basically I shot obsombies with a few others.

53
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,920
It was fun, but not the most impressive VR experience.

54
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,880
There are also a bunch of VR rig setup.

55
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,760
If you're new to VR, you'll have to check them out.

56
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,320
One VR experience that caught my eye was battle zone.

57
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,600
This game had me driving around in a tank shooting enemies.

58
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,120
The seat moved, making it a super immersive experience.

59
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,440
After the eight minutes, I was left wanting more.

60
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,040
The next place I checked out was story rooms.

61
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,760
This area has a few different experiences that are basically there take on escape rooms.

62
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,760
I walked through the Minitor's maze, which actually had some scary moments.

63
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,359
The Minitor's maze, it reminded me of what you get at the void.

64
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:33,480
I really hope that Tubit Circus decides to introduce more of this because it's working and it's

65
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
a lot of fun.

66
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,480
I've also played the space gloves and wrapped VR story rooms and those are a must play with

67
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,880
larger groups.

68
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,799
Tubit Circus is unlike any other arcade I've ever been to.

69
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,440
Even with some games and VR setups, occasionally crashing, there were still always something

70
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,920
fun to experience in something new to see.

71
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,720
That's kind of a testament to what this place is.

72
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,720
It's an ever evolving technology experiment.

73
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,400
I've been here four times now and every time I come back, things have moved and there are

74
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,079
new things to try.

75
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,680
This is an awesome place to take a date or come with a large group of friends.

76
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,359
In fact, I actually had my birthday here last month.

77
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,240
So there you have it, that is Tubit Circus, it's definitely unlike any arcade I've ever

78
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
been to.

79
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,680
You guys have to check it out and you know what, I'm having to give away.

80
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,640
I'm giving away three gift cards worth $50 to some lucky winners head over to my Instagram

81
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,960
