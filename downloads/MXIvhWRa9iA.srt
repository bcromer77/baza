Hey everyone, I have some really exciting news. I'm going to see yes! Oh my god, freaking out.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,240
This has been a goal of mine for a really long time and I'm finally going and I'm going as

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,040
media and I'm going on media days and I'm related, but I'm also a little overwhelmed and that's why

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,840
I'm making this video. If you've been to see yes and you have any tips, that would be amazing.

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,080
Are there any companies or booths that you think I need to go to? I know it's just

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,920
such a huge event and I'm not going to be able to get to everything. So if there's anything you

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,120
think that I should check out, let me know in the comments. I can use all the help that you guys could

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,040
give me. Please. I already have a bunch of meetings set up. Philips you. They have some new products. They're

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:52,080
going to be showing off brilliant this like smart home control switch that I cannot wait to check out and

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,800
I do want to do future videos with them and then I have a meeting with Panasonic and Toto.

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,400
I'm going to do a smart home video of virtual reality video and kind of like an overall what you had to

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,120
see at CES this year video. That one I'm going to have a lot of fun with because I kind of just want to wander

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,400
around like the Sands Expo and find companies that I think are super innovative and are going to have a huge

14
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,200
effect in 2020 in the future. If you want to follow my journey at CES, subscribe to this channel if you

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,080
haven't already and also want to follow me on social media especially Instagram Twitter because I'm

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,760
going to be posting a lot on there. That's more of like behind the scenes and fun quick stuff. So that's

17
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:34,480
pretty much it. I just want to let you guys know that I'm going to... It's like I literally can't get it for it.

18
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:41,840
Have a great holiday season and the next time you see me will be at CES. I'm Justin and I'll see you at

19
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:57,120
CES. That didn't work. I'm Justin and I'll take you later.
