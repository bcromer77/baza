1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the newest recommendation is 7.16 that says consider using CGM in adults with type 2 diabetes,

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
not using insulin or glucose laboratory medication other than insulin.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So we had to look in the literature and there is growing evidence that there are benefits

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
for people with type 2 using CGM, not using insulin.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And so we had to look into the growing research and growing papers and they were able to say,

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
now we feel comfortable that it is sufficient evidence to state that yes, we should consider.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now, why do we not use recommend?

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Because right now we don't have large randomized control trials.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We have some randomized control trial, a lot of retrospective information and some perspectives.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We needed to make sure we use the right level of recommendation to mirror the evidence that we have.
