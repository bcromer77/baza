00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Welcome to a very special episode of The Diabetic Podcast.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,500
We are at ATTD in Amsterdam.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,600
I am joined by Endocrinologist David On.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,600
Thanks for coming back on the show.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,100
Yeah, it's always great to talk to you.

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,800
It's always great to talk to you in Amsterdam.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,600
How sweet is that?

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,200
Of course.

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,600
Yeah, we did this last year and it was a great conversation.

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,200
I knew I had to have you come back on to talk about all of the big announcements.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,900
And this year felt really big.

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,000
There were so many big advancements.

13
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,600
This year that we do have a lot to talk about.

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:37,000
Yeah, and some that are directly relevant to you today with new software updates like control IQ plus for example.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,600
Yeah, well, let's start with that.

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,200
Let's do it.

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,000
So tandem announced their control IQ plus,

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,600
well, that it we're released to everyone in the U.S.

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,800
What, I think one of the biggest things with this is just access to who can use it.

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,200
What were some of the changes to, I mean, some of the ranges or the people that could use it.

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,400
Yeah, so for some background context,

22
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,800
at the same time that they announced approval of the control IQ plus software update,

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,400
it also got FDA approved for type 2 diabetes.

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,200
So that means the T slim and Moby now are FDA approved for type 2 diabetes.

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:23,000
So some of the software features of the control IQ plus upgrade are more tailored to expanding the use of control IQ for people with type 2 diabetes.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,600
So for example, the maximum weight range is a lot higher now,

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,600
because sometimes people with type 2 diabetes have higher body weights.

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,200
Also, the maximum total daily dose as well is much higher.

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,000
That goes all the way up to 200 units a day now.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,800
Right, correct.

31
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,000
So the total max total daily dose now is 200 units a day.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,800
And that also will help people that are heavier, more insulin resistant type 2 diabetes.

33
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,600
And similarly, I think on the low and the numbers got lower as well,

34
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,200
to be a little bit more friendly towards younger patients and the pediatric population.

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,800
Yeah, it's two years and older can use it.

36
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,200
Right.

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,400
And the weight, I think goes as low as 20 pounds.

38
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,000
I think so.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,400
Yeah, and I think total daily dose might be 10 units.

40
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,400
There were also some big features that come to everyone who's using it and everyone who will use it.

41
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,000
There was first extended bolus.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,400
So this allows users to, I think before it was two hours that you could extend a bolus.

43
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,000
That's right.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,600
Now it's eight hours.

45
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
I think it's six hours.

46
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,400
No, it's eight hours.

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Okay.

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
I did yesterday.

49
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
Oh, yeah.

50
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
By the way.

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Look at that.

52
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Look at that.

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
That's pretty cool.

54
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Yeah, no, it's eight hours.

55
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
I did it last night.

56
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
I believe it.

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,400
And it's funny because I feel like two hours felt like not enough time to extend a bolus.

58
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Yeah.

59
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
And eight hours.

60
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
I was like, wow, that's a long time you have.

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,400
How will people benefit from an eight hour extended bolus?

62
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Yeah.

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
So there's a few different types of patients.

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,400
I think that would benefit.

65
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,840
So gastroporosis is, that's when your digestion is slowed.

66
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,600
It's an unfortunate complication of diabetes sometimes.

67
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,080
So people are, some people are a lot slower to digest their food.

68
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,240
So the typical scenario where that happens is if you bolus for a meal, some people will actually

69
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,240
go low and then come up later because their body just takes so long to digest and process that

70
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,640
food into carbohydrates.

71
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,040
So those people benefit from extending their bolus.

72
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,079
So certain foods like pizza, for example, is kind of renowned for having a double spike.

73
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,079
Right?

74
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,480
You get that initial spike from like the bread.

75
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,920
But then there's a lot of cheese and fats and oils that also will have a delayed spike.

76
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,959
So it can be very helpful for foods that have like that dual spike pattern.

77
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:28,959
Yeah.

78
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,799
And in case it wasn't clear what an extendable is does is not it extends that bolus for the

79
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:34,799
sediment of time.

80
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,200
But you set a percentage of how much you want immediately and then what percentage you want

81
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,120
delivered over that time period.

82
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,400
So yeah, so when you eat pizza or something that's super fatty, you'll get that initial amount

83
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,200
and then work with your doctor to, you know, based off of how that will affect you, you know,

84
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
initially.

85
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,720
And then what time period it will take to be released into the bloodstream for me, maybe it's

86
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,440
about four to five hours for those high fatty foods.

87
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,440
Totally.

88
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,200
So a lot of people will do like half of it right up front and then half of it over say four

89
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
hours or so.

90
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,200
Yeah.

91
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,000
Sure, peruses people who are taking GLP ones, that's something that they deal with, right?

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah.

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So can yes.

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,040
So GLP ones, like things like Ozenfick or Mount Jaro can delay gastric emptying, which slows down

95
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
your digestion.

96
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,120
So yes, in those situations, if you're struggling with low blood sugar after a bolus, extending

97
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,960
that bolus might help next, there is temp basil, so tell us about that update.

98
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Yeah.

99
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,600
So temp basals, I think, are a really cool feature that you're going to love.

100
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
And so temp basals are not a new concept.

101
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,600
A lot of pumps had the ability to do temporary basals where you reduce or increase your basal

102
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,160
rate by a percentage for a set amount of time.

103
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,680
But what's neat about this new update is now you can do a temp basal while control like you

104
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,760
was running.

105
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:56,080
So you still get the benefits of automation, it will still increase or decrease your basal if necessary.

106
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,680
But say you're feeling sick or you're going through a part of your menstrual cycle where

107
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,440
you're more resistant to insulin and you need more.

108
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,520
What you can do is you can set a temp basal for up to 72 hours and that means your baseline

109
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,760
insulin delivery is going to go up by a percentage that you specify.

110
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,680
So it can go up to 250% of your normal basal rate and it can go as low as 0% of your normal

111
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
basal rate.

112
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,520
But on top of that, the control like you algorithm will still adjust your insulin if necessary.

113
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,080
Yeah, this is a really powerful feature.

114
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:34,840
And that I myself and many people who are on open source systems and DIY systems have been

115
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,880
using and benefiting from since like 2016.

116
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,320
But it's so great to see that a temp basal within automated insulin has come to an FDA clear

117
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
systems.

118
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,599
I hope others other companies follow suit and not just when you're sick and not just during

119
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:54,520
the menstrual cycle, which is amazing, but also for workouts.

120
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,240
And I've found that, you know, I've used FDA cleared systems recently.

121
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,840
Many of them, including movie before control like you plus, I haven't now.

122
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,520
But for workouts, being able to lower your basal needs and hour before working out is what I need

123
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,280
especially when I'm doing cardio, so being able to do that is amazing for me.

124
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Totally.

125
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,080
And you can still use exercise activity mode and then do the temp basal on top, so that's really

126
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
helpful.

127
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,400
Maybe first learned about this concept by one of my patients who basically was doing

128
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,560
what Justin was talking about, but he was doing it manually.

129
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,680
So he'd create a separate profile for when he would go running and then he would have to switch

130
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,640
to that profile and then turn on control like you.

131
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,320
But now you can just turn on the temp basal and it should be pretty cool.

132
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,880
Yeah, that's what I was doing with my systems as well.

133
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,080
I had to make all these changes, but now it's just a quick little change.

134
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
And then that's interesting.

135
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,120
I mean, I haven't worked out since I updated to control like you plus, but I will probably

136
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,360
do a temp basal and go to activity feature because that raises the target and then there

137
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,560
are, I think there are some changes to the output.

138
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,040
I think it makes it algorithm a little bit less aggressive as well.

139
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Okay.

140
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,560
Next, there is the twist pump, right?

141
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,920
And that is only coming to the U.S., it is a brand new insulin pump that should be releasing

142
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,200
quarter two.

143
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,040
They announced that the pump will be given through pharmacy benefit.

144
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
Right.

145
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,400
Can you tell us a little bit about what that looks like?

146
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
Yeah.

147
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,200
Background is most of the hardware pumps, all the tube pumps before the sequel twist

148
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,720
have gone through what's called DME, it's sensor durable medical equipment.

149
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,120
And that's why you get it from a company like advanced diabetes supply or buy room or something

150
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,280
like that.

151
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,200
And you can't just go to CVS and pick it up.

152
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,320
So when your insurance looks at covering these types of things, they view pharmacy benefit and

153
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,480
hardware benefit as completely different silos.

154
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,360
And hardware benefit, the downside to that, when I say hardware, I mean DME, is that

155
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,320
that's when you get locked into these four-year pump contracts, right?

156
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,080
So with Ventronic and tandem, when you're on the pump, you can't get any other DME pump until

157
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,320
your four-year warranty is up.

158
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,960
But omnipod kind of blaze the way here and getting their omnipod covered solely through pharmacy

159
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,680
benefit, which means that you don't have to worry about DME.

160
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,440
So you could have just gotten the Metronic pump yesterday.

161
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,200
And if you want to switch to omnipod, you can walk into the pharmacy and get an omnipod covered

162
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,000
by your insurance.

163
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,760
So what SQL twist is doing, is they're going to be the first DME pump that I know of,

164
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,640
or I should say tube pump that I know of, that is going to get be pad through the pharmacy

165
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,640
channel.

166
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,000
So same thing, even if you just got a tandem or a Metronic pump one year ago, you would be able

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,919
to try out the twist immediately once it's out, through pharmacy benefit.

168
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,919
Yes.

169
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:43,600
And at least with tandem, one thing I'm taking advantage of right now is they have a 90-day return

170
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
policy.

171
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Correct.

172
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,560
For you within 90 days, you can send it back and you'll get your money back and I like

173
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,400
at least what tandem's doing and what omnipod and twist are doing.

174
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:02,080
They're making it very easy to at least just start on it, right out and then make a decision

175
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
from there.

176
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,120
Of course on tandem after those 90 days, if you decide to keep it, you are stuck in that four

177
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
a year.

178
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Yeah.

179
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Another big thing with twist or a big announcement came was their CGM.

180
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,960
That is the Libre 3 Plus that will be available or be the go-to CGM on launch.

181
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:26,080
Now when I heard that news, my first thought was the Libre 3 Plus can only connect to one device

182
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
at a time.

183
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
Right?

184
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,960
So that means that that will go right to the pump and you won't have share function through

185
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,960
an Abbott Libre app.

186
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,920
So I asked him my interview with Alan Lott then the CEO, which you can go watch later

187
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
this week.

188
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,920
I asked him how will parents be able to view this because the pump is cleared for six years

189
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
enough.

190
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,640
Well, they're going to have a follow-up on launch with this exciting.

191
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,640
And that's really important because obviously, yeah, being able to follow your child or have

192
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,720
your spouse follow you is a huge deal and like Justin said, that's one of the biggest limitations

193
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,200
to using Libre in an AID system.

194
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,760
So right now, the burden is on the pump companies to build in that sharing because the sensor

195
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,400
can only share data to the pump.

196
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,200
It can't share it on its own to the phone.

197
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:24,400
So beta-bionic says something called bionic circle which kind of recreates that sharing capability.

198
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,040
And I believe tandem is working on something like that too.

199
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,920
Well, that's exciting because they work with Libre 2 Plus and then so does Omni pod and hopefully

200
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,959
Omni pod also comes with a share.

201
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:36,959
Yeah, I don't.

202
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:37,959
Yeah.

203
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:38,959
I'm not quite sure.

204
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:39,959
They may already have a share feature.

205
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:40,959
I'm not sure.

206
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:41,959
Like right at the second.

207
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:42,959
Okay.

208
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,040
We're going to take a quick break because this show floor is officially closing.

209
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,040
It's getting a little crazy.

210
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
I'm closing down the show.

211
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,439
Yeah, let's find another spot to be in.

212
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:52,839
So yeah, we'll see you in a little bit.

213
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:55,760
This episode is sponsored by Omni pod.

214
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,839
You guys know that staying connected to the tech world is important to me.

215
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,959
But what's also important to me is my insulin pump.

216
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,640
Omni pod 5 is tubeless and waterproof.

217
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,560
Which means I never have to disconnect from automated insulin delivery even when I take

218
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,280
a shower, go swimming or go to the gym.

219
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,680
Staying connected to my insulin pump means I'm spending more time in automated mode which ultimately

220
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,960
helps me spend more time and range.

221
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,360
See if you're eligible for a 30 day trial by visiting Omni pod.com slash diabetec on there.

222
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,600
You'll see full safety and risk information and trial terms.

223
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Again, that's Omni pod.com slash diabetec.

224
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,200
Let's get back into twist.

225
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:42,200
So I also asked the CEO about other CGM compatibility because the loop algorithm that

226
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,600
powers it comes from the we are not waiting community that wants interoperability.

227
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,680
Like, so I kind of framed it that way.

228
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,240
I was like, well, what about other CGMs?

229
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,920
Why just one?

230
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,680
And he really said that it came down to the ban with that they have right now.

231
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,800
So he did say that liberate three plus now, but they want to bring other CGMs.

232
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
He did specifically say DEXCOM.

233
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,840
So I wouldn't be surprised if we did see that in the near future for the system.

234
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,320
Yeah, and in my conversations with a sequel as well, I think it's a big priority to them,

235
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,520
which is really exciting.

236
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,720
Many of the people as part of the team actually came from the we are not waiting movement.

237
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,560
So I think it is interoperability is a huge deal.

238
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,320
I actually see that as kind of a win by bringing Libre first because so many other systems

239
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,720
started with DEXCOM.

240
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,480
It's kind of nice to see for the first time as a system start with Libre.

241
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,640
And then add DEXCOM later.

242
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,960
But I agree, I think it's going to come to DEX, they're going to bring DEXCOM into the fold.

243
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,680
And I hope other sensors like EverSense and other sensors down the road.

244
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,000
Speaking of DEXCOM, you went to their symposium and you mentioned they brought back data

245
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,280
of the 15 day CGM that is now with the FDA.

246
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,840
What were the findings there?

247
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,280
Yeah, so it was kind of hot off the press.

248
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,360
One of the big announcements at this conference was DEXCOM shared the results of their trial

249
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,920
data that where they get the 15 day sensor approved.

250
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,200
So they had to show that it was accurate, that it was reliable, things like that.

251
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,320
And one of the things that I learned from that talk was they actually have an updated algorithm.

252
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,120
That's powering the G715 day.

253
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,480
And they shared that in that study the Mard, which is the most commonly accepted measurement

254
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,080
of accuracy, was actually even better than the 10 day sensor.

255
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:27,960
So it had a Mard of 8.0%, the traditional G7 has a Mard of 8.2%.

256
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:33,080
So they actually improved their accuracy metric, presumably because of the updated algorithm.

257
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,240
So that's kind of, I didn't know that was coming, so that was cool.

258
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
Yeah, it's funny.

259
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,680
You don't really think algorithm that often when you think just CGM, you think algorithm.

260
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,640
It's my automated insulin system and how it uses those numbers.

261
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:50,400
But CGMs, you were telling me, CGMs have their own algorithm that they're using to clean up data

262
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,840
that's going on in the background, things that we don't see and we don't need to see really.

263
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:01,280
Yeah, what I'm wondering here is though, it sounds like when they were testing the Mard of the new 15 day,

264
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:09,400
that it's really, it could be just that new algorithm that helps make the Mard better.

265
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:18,120
But I'd be curious to know if they put the new algorithm on the 10 day sensor and truly could tell us if there was any difference

266
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,560
in accuracy when it comes to hardware.

267
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,320
And the length that you're wearing the CGM, right?

268
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
Right.

269
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,920
So a couple of things I can think of from there.

270
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,200
So one, I agree, I kind of have the same question.

271
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,040
It's like, wait, like, is this a software upgrade, is this a hardware upgrade?

272
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,120
And as far as I can tell, it's a pure software upgrade.

273
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:42,200
In the sense that I think the hardware of the G7 and the G7 15 day are going to be the exact same.

274
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,760
But it's like the software layer on top that we don't interact with, right?

275
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,600
That algorithm that just and I were talking about, where it kind of cleans up the data and presents

276
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
you with the number.

277
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,880
I think that part of it is cleaned up and is going to be a little bit more precise.

278
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,440
So yeah, but a part of me was like, I remember sitting in my chair thinking, wait, like, why don't they just bring

279
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,920
the new updated algorithm to the 10 day G7?

280
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,920
Yeah.

281
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,920
But, at the same time, to be fair, I think they're going to transition probably everybody over, I would think,

282
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
to the 15 day.

283
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Yeah.

284
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,520
And I believe, first of all, that algorithm must be what is with the FDA, right?

285
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,960
I can't just put out a new algorithm update, I think, for this medical device, it needs

286
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:25,760
to be cleared because it's such an important, it's a little bit outside of, yeah, I guess it's

287
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,760
definitively.

288
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,439
But you know, I think they're trying to move forward and they're going to bring into their latest

289
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:31,439
product.

290
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:35,840
So one other thing that surprised me at the conference when it comes to DEXCOM was their collaboration

291
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:42,880
with Novo Nordisk on a connection between Novo Nordisk's smart hands and the DEXCOM G7.

292
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,920
Now, this is Europe only, it just brings another smart pen into the market that works with

293
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
this major CGM.

294
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:56,439
But also, the information from the smart pen goes directly into the G7 app.

295
00:15:56,439 --> 00:16:00,800
So I'm not asked when I were with the Novo Pen DEXCOM partnership, but I agree with Justin.

296
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,760
I think these connected insulin pens, they do prevent present a unique opportunity for people

297
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,800
who aren't yet ready to go on AID, maybe they can't afford it, maybe they don't want

298
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,040
to go on a pump.

299
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,199
But they still want some benefits of automation or not automation, but, you know, they

300
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,719
do want some benefits of having calculations done for them.

301
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:23,839
So you can take advantage of these smart pens or connected pens, combine CGM data and then put

302
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,800
like a bullish calculator on top, and you can get some of the features of an insulin pump

303
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,959
in a pen.

304
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:35,160
And it's cool to have other options because Metronic has done something similar with the Simplera

305
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,520
CGM and the In Pen, which they make.

306
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,520
So it's nice to have like different ecosystems and more alternative, more alternatives in that

307
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
space.

308
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
Yeah.

309
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:51,120
Another device that surprised me this year that I was not expecting was a new generation of pump

310
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,520
from Calado, the company is Vescentra and it's Calado 2.

311
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:02,160
So this pump that was already pretty small, it's worn like a tandem movie, it's adhered to the

312
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,960
body and then a little tube coming out of it with the infusion site is one way to where you

313
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,720
could also just, you know, put it in your pocket and have a longer tube.

314
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,520
But this new pump is like about 10% smaller.

315
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,240
It comes in a bunch of colors, six colors, and I like these new ones have a more matte finish.

316
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,040
The current Calado are very shiny, a lot of the colors, I mean, they're pretty, but they're

317
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,240
like hot pink and like very bright blue and these are really a bit toned down.

318
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,600
Like the pink is almost like a pearl pink with a nice matte finish.

319
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:38,040
So they look much more elevated, they use the same infusion sets.

320
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,240
And the company was saying that because this pump, there are changes to it, but because there

321
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:49,520
are a lot of similarities that it could streamline the process of submission for CE mark.

322
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,399
And currently it's only available in three countries, France, Netherlands and Germany.

323
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:59,760
They are planning to get CE mark and bring it to those, but then their next phase is really

324
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,879
getting it into the US through FDA clearance.

325
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,879
So that was exciting.

326
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:06,240
Was there anything that like stuck out to you with this pump?

327
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,560
I think the Calado, just like as someone who's on, you know, on social media and the Type 1

328
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,160
Diabetes Space, like the Calado was the pump that I always get jealous about.

329
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,160
You know, it's like you look, and you see people sharing it from, you know, you're up and

330
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,040
you're like, that's a pretty cool looking pump.

331
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,200
So I agree with Justin, I was telling him before we went on camera.

332
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,760
It's kind of like a blend of the Omni-Pod 5 and the tandem mobile.

333
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,160
It has like the versatility of the mobile, but it's a little bit more sleek and it's

334
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,840
patch option than the mobile.

335
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,400
So I love options, so bring it on.

336
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:43,800
Yeah, it's a very sleek look similar to Omni-Pod, where Omni-Pod doesn't have any creases

337
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
in it.

338
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,200
You can't see like multiple parts.

339
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
It's an all in one, right?

340
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
Yeah.

341
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,840
Whereas like something like the mobile, which I'm wearing, has the, what is that?

342
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,840
The cartridge.

343
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,280
Yeah, the cartridge, that's like one color, then you've got the pump, that's another color.

344
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,399
It's a little more medical-looking, collado kind of looks like piece of jewelry in some ways.

345
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:06,440
And funny enough, I'm wearing the collado adhesive right now.

346
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
Oh, cool.

347
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:15,639
So did you notice, I'm wearing the Moby and I'm not using the adhesive, I mean, I'm using a collado

348
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:16,639
adhesive.

349
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:21,720
Yeah, I found some, and it's a perfect size.

350
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:27,879
And also look at how it looks when I have my pump off, it's not this huge piece with like

351
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,200
a plastic tray, and then, you know, a whole piece of cloth that goes around it, it's very

352
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
simple.

353
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,600
So I do really like that.

354
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,600
And if you can find collado adhesive patches in your Moby's, or I highly recommend, of course,

355
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,200
you can wear Moby in your pocket as well, or clip it, but business opportunity, if you live

356
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,040
in one of those three countries, you can just start black market shipping amount to the United

357
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
States.

358
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
Yep.

359
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,280
And I spoke to Tana, and I asked them, I said, is your adhesive patch, like an FDA thing, did

360
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,280
you need to get clearance?

361
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
And they said, no.

362
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,360
It's a medical piece of their product.

363
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,360
Yeah.

364
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,360
So I said, maybe, like I understand that adhesive patch is so great for physical activity, especially

365
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,360
when you're running.

366
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,760
That thing is not going anywhere.

367
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,680
With this one, your pump will probably fall off, but there are so many different, you know, aspects

368
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:20,040
of our lives that maybe, you know, one time I want to wear this, maybe if I'm running a marathon,

369
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
I'll wear the other one.

370
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,040
For sure.

371
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,879
Maybe they can have a few different options of adhesive patches.

372
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,120
Today's episode is sponsored by T1D Exchange.

373
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:35,520
You can directly make an impact on diabetes health care, treatments, and technology by participating

374
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,000
in the T1D Exchange registry.

375
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,120
It starts with a simple survey about your life with T1D, and it only takes about 15 minutes.

376
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,640
After that, you'll have a personal portal with ongoing T1D study and survey opportunities.

377
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,840
Plus, some of these studies even offer compensation.

378
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,840

381
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:07,439
Let's get back to colido.

382
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:11,879
A couple of things that they told me was the new pump has an accelerometer in it.

383
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:12,879
Oh, okay.

384
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:13,879
What do you think of that?

385
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:14,879
That is cool.

386
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:19,040
I mean, potentially you could use that for like algorithm stuff, like if you're, if it notices

387
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,800
physical activity, not as pretty cool.

388
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Yeah.

389
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
That was a surprise.

390
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,240
They said that what they're doing is whether or not it's used on launch is in there, so that

391
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,680
it's, this pump can last longer and they can continue to make upgrades to algorithm and things

392
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,840
like that and incorporate it, because, yeah, if you're running really fast, that accelerometer

393
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,840
will pick that up.

394
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,040
There's also a temperature sensor in there.

395
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
That's cool.

396
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,879
Now, the temperature sensor, it's not like for your human body to sense what your temperature

397
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:51,040
is, and they said that because like people wear their pump in all different areas, and

398
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,120
you can't really control that.

399
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
But it's really a temperature sensor for the insulin.

400
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
Yeah.

401
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,159
And to let you know, hey, your insulin's a little warm, you need to leave where you are or change

402
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:02,159
your pods soon.

403
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,800
I almost wonder if you could like combine those two and like detect when you're sleepy, right?

404
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,760
Because like less movement, but they're still warm, right?

405
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,040
And then maybe it changes the algorithm in a certain way.

406
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
That would be cool.

407
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
So, yeah.

408
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:20,040
If you're running and you're really hot, like odds are there's, there's impact when you're

409
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,120
running in the heat, right, or your, or your body heat that's coming off of your skin.

410
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,120
And I know there's something there, so it's exciting to see that they're putting these, you

411
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
know, sensors in there.

412
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,120
That is really cool.

413
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,120
Yeah.

414
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,120
I didn't know that.

415
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,520
A couple other things for colito two was that app control will come on launch for Android

416
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,520
and iPhone.

417
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,760
Currently, you need a PDM for the device.

418
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Nice.

419
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,600
It's running the Diabalute G1 algorithm.

420
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Nice.

421
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:50,000
Although the colito two will most likely have the G2 algorithm of that, and USB-C in the charger.

422
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,680
Which is probably, well, definitely because Europe made them.

423
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,920
And as made everyone in Europe have USB-C, which I'm, I'm all for.

424
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Yes.

425
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
I'm all for it.

426
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Love the iPhone, being USB-C.

427
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
It's great.

428
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Yeah.

429
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,760
Let's talk about this new terminology that's been spoken about at this conference.

430
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,320
So, one term, we actually talked about it last year on the podcast was Time and Tight Range,

431
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,320
which is also Time and Pregnancy Range, right?

432
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,320
It's 70 to 140?

433
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
Is that?

434
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,320
Yeah.

435
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
I see a 63 to 140.

436
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,120
Time and Tight Range, I've seen it defined differently, but the most conventional is 70 to 140.

437
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,040
Sometimes I'll see 65 to 140, just to make it on par with Pregnancy, but yeah.

438
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,040
Okay.

439
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
And that's milligrams for desolator.

440
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,040
Do you know millimilimals on that?

441
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
No.

442
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,040
But quick trick.

443
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
You just divided by 18.

444
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
I didn't know that.

445
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,840
First, I had a patient encounter, and I was like, bushing at my calculator or like, going to Google.

446
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,040
And then later, I learned I just had to divide by 18.

447
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,040
Yeah.

448
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,560
I learned that this week, and I mean, the easiest way to do it, at least my, the top of my range is

449
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,560
180.

450
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
One, 80s, at least 10.

451
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
Yep.

452
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,240
And I just used that, because dividing these by 18s is not that easy.

453
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,240
Yeah.

454
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,560
And then four on the floor, 72 is a low blood sugar.

455
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
Okay.

456
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,560
So that's Time and Tight Range.

457
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:04,080
But there's this new terminology that's being spoken about, which is, Ting, time in normal

458
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
glucose.

459
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
Right.

460
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,280
Now, this new terminology was created because there was controversy over Time and Tight Range being

461
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:17,120
to intensive an asker, or tell us more about why Time and Tight Range, why people felt like

462
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,520
that needed a new name.

463
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Yeah.

464
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,200
So the funny thing is, I don't even think the name was the huge issue, but the concept

465
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:31,080
of it is somewhat controversial because, you know, I think we talked about this last year, but

466
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,120
the general fear is that basically by moving the yard posts, right, by moving the goal posts

467
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,480
and saying, like, oh, no, we're no longer shooting for Time and Range from 70 to 180.

468
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,080
Now we're actually wanting you to go to 70 to 140.

469
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,400
But we know that with Type 1 Diabetes, especially, that's really hard to do, you know?

470
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,080
And we don't want to discourage people, and we don't want people to feel like they're

471
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,400
falling short because we know that the data is very good behind Time and Range.

472
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:02,240
And if you maintain that 70% Time and Range, it really reduces your risk of having complications.

473
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,320
So I think a lot of people, especially those of us who are clinicians or patients or people

474
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,520
with diabetes that are very, you know, protective of kind of the emotional burden and mental

475
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,560
state of people with diabetes, I think we've been very resistant to kind of adopting Time

476
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,560
and Tight Range.

477
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,320
And people feel like that's where they need to be, and that they should really be focusing

478
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,879
on 70 and 140.

479
00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:26,679
Now, if you can get there, or if you're that type of patient, and some people are that type of

480
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:33,679
patient who really, really wants to kind of be on the edge of normal blood or of tight blood

481
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,159
trigger control, it's fine to have that metric.

482
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:41,360
But the controversy is just how much we want to push that, and how much we want to standardize

483
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,040
that, and make that kind of the goal rather than talking about Time and Range.

484
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,840
And there's a lot of controversy, because some people are very excited about it.

485
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,680
Personally, I think a lot of the companies are very excited about it, because they want, they kind

486
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,440
of want tighter metrics to be able to prove that their algorithms are better, and you know,

487
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,440
we're serving people with diabetes better because we have a better time and tight range than

488
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
other companies.

489
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
Interesting.

490
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,680
So there are, some companies are able to say, wow, we have a really high percentage in this

491
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,480
even more so than all these other companies, whereas when you're using that larger range, well,

492
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,640
it's not as high a bracket and everyone kind of fits it.

493
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,000
Yeah, I think they're just trying to find ways to differentiate and make their system sound better,

494
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
which is great.

495
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,280
Like we want, of course, the best control we can, but we also don't want to, you know, set standards

496
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,640
that are very difficult to achieve that could be discouraging, and that's the delicate balance.

497
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,960
So they had a big group meeting here at this conference to kind of talk about it, the pros and cons,

498
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,480
and I guess one of the things I came up was, can they come up with a better name for it, and

499
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,160
the name that they landed on was Ting, which is time in normal glucose or time in normal

500
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,160
glycine.

501
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:51,640
As soon as I heard it, the word normal struck me the wrong way.

502
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,640
I'm the same as you.

503
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,640
Yeah.

504
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,080
Especially because I feel like when we've tried to come up with terminology and the diabetes space,

505
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,480
I feel like we're so sensitive to, to, to, to, to verbiage and no one clasher that, I agree.

506
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,200
Like hearing that word normal kind of like, you know, like, my, my, I twitch a little bit

507
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,080
because then it implies that if you're not there, you're abnormal, right?

508
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,720
Which, which is not the purpose of time and time range.

509
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,800
So I think that's like, like, hopefully that name is not the final name.

510
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Yeah.

511
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
So let us know what you think of those two.

512
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,680
I'll be putting a poll on Instagram, and I want to hear from you.

513
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:32,000
And if you don't like either of those, you'll have to let us know in the comments on here or on Instagram

514
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
of what you think it should be.

515
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Give us some ideas.

516
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,640
And maybe we can send those over to the powers that be and let them, you know, choose between one

517
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,640
of those.

518
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,640
Yeah.

519
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,640
Maybe if they have a third, better suggestion.

520
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Yeah.

521
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,640
Or we'll just make it happen.

522
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
We can make that happen.

523
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,640
And we will.

524
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,640
Yeah.

525
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,920
Well, that's really everything I had on, on my list was, if you took one thing from this whole

526
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,920
week, what would you say, what was something you were most excited about?

527
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
It could be big.

528
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
It could be small.

529
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,720
I mean, I, just being the nerd I am, I was just really excited about learning about

530
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
the 15 day sensor.

531
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,840
I think hearing that it has an updated algorithm gives me excitement.

532
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,840
And just knowing that things are, there are other things coming around the corner.

533
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,040
Like, I think this could be an opportunity for DEXCOM to really, you know, make a really strong

534
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
impression.

535
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,600
And to kind of write some of the wrongs, you know, the G7 launch was pretty rocky.

536
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,800
I think most of us would agree that is, was the case.

537
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,440
It sounds like they're actually very being very purposeful about the 15 day launch.

538
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,920
They're going to kind of wait until they have really good supply, until it has more pump

539
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,920
integrations.

540
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,080
So I think they're going to really try to make sure that the 15 day launch goes smoothly.

541
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,080
And so, so that's what I'm excited about.

542
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,080
Yeah.

543
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:47,600
I think I was most excited about twist and it's, well, Libra 3 because I would love to use a pump

544
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
with Libra 3.

545
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:55,040
I've never done that before, but also the Pharmacy Benefit Manager ability to get that pump so easily

546
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:01,440
and just try it four a month, try it for three months and then not be held to it.

547
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,760
My goal this year is to try every insulin pump available in the U.S.

548
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
That's awesome.

549
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,640
I've tried OmniPot Dash, Loop, Trio, OmniPot 5, MonMovie right now, which you could just

550
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,840
say I use tandem, T-Slim kind, I mean, it's the same algorithm, so I'm not rushing to use that

551
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,840
one, but I want to use twist, I want to use metronic, beta bionics.

552
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,800
That's my goal this year and hearing from twist that that is a possibility.

553
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:31,400
So, so simple, I mean, we know insurance companies is not always that simple, but I will

554
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,040
know how simple it is, but that's that excited to me, I mean, this is an awesome pump with

555
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,040
a cool algorithm that it that's from the open source community originally and we call to use

556
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
it.

557
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,800
Yeah, and just hearing you lay out all those different pumps, I think it's so exciting, right?

558
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:50,040
Like even just three years ago it was like X2, metronic and OmniPot, right?

559
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,800
But now we have beta bionics, now we have the sequel twist, we have MoBee, we have potentially

560
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,400
colido and all these different things we have, and we have more sensors before it was just

561
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,920
X-Comb versus metronic, now we have Sensionics, now we are Sensionics ever since, now we

562
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:08,760
have Libre, it's it's really exciting and you know, we get so excited about interoperability,

563
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,680
you guys deserve to have a choice in your algorithm, you choose your pump, you choose your

564
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,520
sensor and I think we're slowly getting there and it's it's really exciting.

565
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:22,960
It is slow, it is a slow process and I always say I chose the wrong industry to be an influencer

566
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:28,920
because there's also so much red tape, but I think going to these conferences every year,

567
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:34,360
quarterly, we at least get to see the progress, the micro-progress that means a lot.

568
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,000
So I'm glad that we could do this here David, thank you so much for sharing.

569
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,880
We want to hear what is the technology or anything that you heard about ATTD, this here, what

570
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,360
what are you most excited about?

571
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,440
Let us know in the comments and also subscribe to the podcast wherever you listen or on YouTube

572
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,080
for video form, I'm Justin, this is David and we'll take you later.
