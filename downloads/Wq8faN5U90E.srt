1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
you know, so many people are jaded that there will ever be a cure. Many of them are listening.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,720
What would you say to them that as to why there is hope?

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,240
Yeah. I mean, well, let's start with why they're jaded. They think that all the big

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,040
pharma companies are making their bajillions of insulin. At this point, they're not making

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:25,680
very much money off insulin. And they would make money off a cure. Let's say next week, a cure

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,880
for type one diabetes is FDA approved. We're not going to all have our hands on that cure,

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,880
even within the next five years. You know what I mean? Like, it's going to take a while to get around

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,680
30 million people in the US who have type two diabetes. Type ones make up like last I saw

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,240
is 1.7 million in the US. The pharma companies can survive without us. Because they have a future

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,000
50 million people. Type two diabetes. Many of whom are going to continue to need insulin.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,720
They don't need us. And they have all these GOP one medications and many more coming down the pipeline

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,440
that are making them the big box. Stop with the money thing. That's just silly. Once you understand

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:15,120
the deeper workings. I mean, the CEOs and the lead researchers in these organizations that are driving

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,440
cure research, Doug Melton, for example, is not going to be bought out by a big pharma to hide

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,280
his cure in his pocket. He wants to cure his son and his story is not unique.
