00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
I had a crazy situation with my Dex CompG7 sensors this week, and I needed to tell you about it.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,120
The other day I was going to hop on a train, but before I did I had to put on a new

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,800
sensor, so I put it on, let it do its thing, was on my way to the train, and I realized that

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,800
the sensor never connected to the app after I put in the code. It just couldn't find the sensor,

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,120
so I had to go back, I wound up missing my train, got a new Dex CompG7, put it on,

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:33,520
and the same issue happened. It kept scanning for a sensor but never found one. So I had to call Dex

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,920
Comp, Dex Comp let me know that this is an issue people are having. Dex Comp had me find the number

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,840
on the box, that is under number 21, so make sure you take a picture of that and you have that.

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,360
It's on both the applicator and the box, you just have to have a picture of that and you can give them that code.

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,640
That way these replacements aren't part of their like three replacement policy. This is a failure

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,480
and they will replace it, and it's not part of that. This had me a little concern,

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,800
no, because what if I had taken these as my backups for vacation? And I would be out of luck. Also,

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,400
right now I'm traveling a lot outside the US. If this happened to me, I would have no idea what to do.

14
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,640
I would have to put something on social media asking if there's anyone around. I don't think that they

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,760
would be able to send them to me outside the US. Dex Comp correct me if I'm wrong. I learned a few things

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:28,240
here. First of all, if yours has a similar rev number or serial number as mine, make sure you bring

17
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,440
others that aren't part of that batch. Luckily, I had another sensor, my third sensor to put on,

18
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,320
and that was a different rev batch, and it worked just fine. So I'm only taking those with me to

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,440
live in later today. I have like five of those, and I'm like praying that there's no issues with that.

20
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,440
Are you having any Dex Comp failures? What is that situation? And if you are having a failure,

21
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,880
how long is it taking for you to get replacements? I've heard about shortages. I haven't necessarily

22
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,280
experienced that, but yeah, let me know in the comments. This experience really freaked me out and showed

23
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,800
me how tied we are to technology and how one little technical difficulty can make us miss a train,

24
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,240
freak us out and could theoretically put our treatment on pause and put us in a situation where we're just

25
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,240
not as ready to tackle our diabetes. I was nervous. I was off to go to the zoo and this really just

26
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,360
put a damper on my morning. Thank goodness. I got a sensor to work and I'm so thankful that I figured this

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,280
out before going to Europe. Let me know what you think in the comments and follow this page for more
