00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
Hey everyone, it's Justin Tech, and I just got back from this festival, it's a little

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,620
festival.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,120
I'm not sure if you've heard of it, but it's called Coachella.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:14,560
Now I've got a few tech tips to get you through this year's festival, hashtag TechChella.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:21,720
Probably the most important tip out there is time stamp your text, because service is horrible

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,720
out there.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,600
And those time stamps that you already have on your phones, they're going to be wrong because

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,280
your message won't get delivered or received after correct time.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,320
So always put the time that you're sending that text that you're going to you

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,880
attend back right, go in the main stage, far left, S3, 24601, who knows, anyway, put a time

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,880
stamp on your text.

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,880
It will come in handy.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,760
People will know that at 654, you were headed over there, and that at 655, they can

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,280
head over there now too.

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,320
Make your wallpaper on your phone, the set list, then you can also set up circles right on your wallpaper,

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,400
that way you have them all circled, and you can kind of see what your day looks like.

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,280
You can even send it to a friend, that way you can kind of compare what your schedules look

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,280
like.

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,000
It is the best, what I'm going to do is I'm going to put the PDFs for those wallpapers right in

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
a link below.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,480
Feel free to download them, use them, I want you to use them.

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,120
Also, next year I'll put a new link, this one is very important.

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,039
It's called the Over the Shoulder Text folder.

24
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,840
Now what is that you might ask?

25
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,040
Let's see you have a set that's coming up real soon, and you need to get there with your

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,280
friend, but you also need to let their group know that you're going, and you don't really

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
have much time.

28
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,760
What you do is, you put your shoulder over your friend, they text your friends, and you guide them.

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Get through the crowd and message at the same time.

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,000
This one is very, very, very important if you want good pictures.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,120
So what you do is you tell your friend to go over there, where you want the picture, your

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,320
frame it, really well, and you tell his person, oh, thank you so much.

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,440
You might just holding that right there and pressing that button, I don't need you to do anything

34
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,440
else.

35
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,960
No need to use your creative freedom, use mine, thank you so much, thank you so much, thank you so

36
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
much.

37
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,080
Anyway, take that phone, take that right there, I love the headspace, and then you go in the

38
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,840
picture, and bought a big, bought a boom, you got a picture, and it's great.

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,000
Now another option, if you feel like being bossy, you can just go up to a random group and be like,

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,200
hey, who in this group takes the best pictures, be honest, who is the most followers, hashtag

41
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Chek Shella.

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:25,440
Alrighty guys, next tip is that you must, must, where a smart watch or a fit fit have mine right

43
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
here.

44
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,120
I highly recommend wearing a smart watch because then what you can do is you can set reminders,

45
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,160
eye call events that will go off on your wrist, that way when you're literally messed up.

46
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,000
Now you have nothing to think about unless your wrist goes off, you're also going to get text

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,600
and phone calls through your wrist, and you'll know who to answer or ignore.

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,320
Those are all the tech tips I have for Coachella or basically any festival, I hope they
