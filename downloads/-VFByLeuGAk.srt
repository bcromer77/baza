00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Hey guys, welcome to my Apple iPad keyboard review and comparison video.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,640
So if I've had this keyboard since Christmas and I absolutely love it,

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,240
I'm also going to be comparing that keyboard to the Logitech keyboards,

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,640
the rugged folio, and the slim folio.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,400
For the purposes of this video, I'm using my iPad 10.2 inch,

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,880
but Apple and Logitech make keyboards for all of the different iPads.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,280
I'm going to be sure to put links to all of these products in the description below.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,400
Alright, let's do this.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,280
The iPad keyboard is sleek, compact, and light.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,840
It connects via the smart connector on your iPad,

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,000
meaning there's no need to connect via Bluetooth or charge the keyboard.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's instantly powered by and connected to the iPad.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,560
The keyboard doubles as a smart cover, and magnetically folds and covers your iPad,

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,280
creating a slim ultra portable package.

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,519
The keyboard's made of a plastic material, and it's supposedly water resistant.

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,920
But Apple doesn't market it as such.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,680
It should be fine if it gets a little wet.

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,640
It only comes in this great color, which is a bit of a bummer.

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,800
I'd love some cute color options.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,840
The keyboard keys are small, but after just a few minutes of getting used to, they feel comfortable.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,360
The keys have a great tactile response and are extremely quiet.

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,080
So like I said, the keyboard's really quiet.

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,920
And I just want to show you how quiet the keyboard actually is.

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,360
I'm going to use these fingers.

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,920
I'm going to turn here.

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,880
I'm going to type them on the keyboard right here.

27
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,280
So there you go.

28
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,960
I will say occasionally the space part doesn't react,

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,920
and that's because it needs a bit of a more forceful push.

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,880
This hasn't really been a big issue for me since my iPad corrects my grammar anyway.

31
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,960
You can also prop up the iPad in a steeper position for watching video,

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,000
or using the iPad as a second display for your laptop.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,560
While I'm on that topic, I just posted a video on how to use your iPad as a second display,

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,440
to watch that just click that link right up there in the top corner.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,720
The lack of a trackpad isn't really an issue here.

36
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,560
I don't find that I need it for my iPad workflow, but if I really need a mouse, I can connect one V of

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,400
Bluetooth. I like how little room the keyboard takes up, and I feel comfortable using it in a small space.

38
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,000
The keyboard seems to be meant for mainly using on surfaces.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,320
I've used it on my laptop a bit, and while it's not horrible, the iPad is a bit shaky,

40
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,519
and it's not ideal.

41
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,160
Oh, and on the complete opposite side of the spectrum, if you're using it on a metal table,

42
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,560
that keyboard is going to be very secure.

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,320
So secure that you can't easily move it, which I actually found helpful as soon as I found a good position for it.

44
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,000
And this is a huge plus for me, because I live in Los Angeles where the big earthquake can hit

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,200
at any time, and I'm going to be set because if I'm using that iPad keyboard on a metal table,

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,760
it won't go anywhere. Thanks Apple!

47
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,520
And lastly, I'm going to tell you now this keyboard isn't cheap. It's $159 on Apple's website,

48
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,960
and I found it for $143 on Amazon, so I threw that link in the description below.

49
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,800
Now let's get into the keyboard abilities.

50
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,040
To my surprise, all of the hot keys that you're used to on Mac are present here on the iPad.

51
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,959
So to figure out what hot keys you can use, you just hold down a command on any app or the home screen,

52
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,200
and it shows you what you can do. So right here, it's showing me what I can do. I can do command spacebar,

53
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,640
and I can search for apps. I can go to pages, let's say, and I hold down command, and it shows me

54
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,799
all of the hot keys I can use here. And then when I click in, it'll show me more. Right there, bold,

55
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,640
command, I as I tell it. And then if I want to switch between apps, I just do command tab,

56
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:52,000
then I'm switching between apps. So let me go into Safari. I can do command T for a new tab,

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,160
out. That hot key, burn me, top. Okay, back to this command H, we'll take me home, and in mail,

58
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,320
I can do command N, and I can do a new draft. If I go to I message, I can do command I, and sorry,

59
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:14,000
command N, and it's a new message. So hot keys are really awesome here. I find this to be a key feature,

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,079
pun intended. These hot keys make using the keyboard, and I've had a super enjoyable and productive

61
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:27,120
experience. Also, I just want to take a second to say how incredibly amazed I am by my iPad workflow.

62
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,320
Like this thing has completely changed my coffee shop work sessions. Yes, I am that guy that's in Starbucks,

63
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,680
or some sort of trendy cute coffee shop for hours. And you know what, I am not sorry about it,

64
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:45,360
because things can get super lonely here. My office literally has me. But if you want to be my

65
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,360
assistant for free, let me know right in the comments. Anyway, I can quickly swap between apps,

66
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,760
use apps side by side, and type out reviews, just like this one. And side note, I did type this entire

67
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,760
review on my iPad keyboard. If I wasn't a video editor, I could easily see myself using this as my

68
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,200
main computer. I'm able to complete most of my work tasks and write reviews, update logs and

69
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,760
Google sheets, and docs, and work on social media. I highly recommend the iPad and keyboard combo.

70
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,680
It's going to change your life. Now let's talk about the competing keyboards. The main

71
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,200
competitors in my view are the Logitech keyboards. Each keyboard has their own pros and cons, and it's

72
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,159
going to be up to you to decide which one suits your lifestyle most. Also, all those hot keys I showed

73
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,960
you earlier, any keyboard you connect to your iPad will have them. First, there's the rugged

74
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,360
folio, which goes for $140. The keyboard is water and dirt resistant, and the case is shock absorbent.

75
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,880
Hence the name, rugged. The keyboard connects via the smart connectors well, so it is instantly powered

76
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,400
and connected to your iPad. The keyboard keys are slightly larger than apples, and feel closer to a

77
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,880
laptop keyboard. There's less of a tactile response, but I personally like it. The keys are quiet, soft,

78
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,000
and a little more flat. We're back for another session of tech ASMR. All right here. We have

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:25,520
the Logitech rocket folio. There's a row of short cut keys on top, which make it super easy to

80
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,039
adjust settings. These are missed on Apple's keyboard. The only issue I have is with the Logitech.

81
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,760
I keep on accidentally pushing it when I'm trying to hit delete, it's really annoying. I wish there

82
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,640
was a way to just turn this off because I don't even find it necessary. The case has a kick stand that

83
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,760
allows for a bunch of different setups, but it does take up more room, and you can't use it on your lab.

84
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,200
It weighs much more than the Apple keyboard, and it's three times as thick. As someone who already

85
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,719
carries a laptop, I don't personally really need another heavy-duty piece of equipment on me.

86
00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:04,880
But don't get me wrong. This is a great case. Next is the slim folio, which goes for $99. This keyboard

87
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,520
runs via Bluetooth, so you'll need to connect it to your iPad, and for the most part it should connect

88
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,640
whenever you turn it on. Logitech says the battery will last you four years until you need to replace it.

89
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,480
When typing the keys feel and sound much closer to a laptop.

90
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,560
Hey, I know you thought you got rid of me, but I'm back for one more session with these.

91
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:34,240
It's much more like a keyboard. You've also got that row of shortcut keys. Most notably, they

92
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,760
aren't water or dirt resistance, like the other two. So perhaps this is a buy-it-nice or buy-it twice

93
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,600
kind of moment. The case feels much cheaper and only has one setup. I find that the angle of the iPad

94
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,720
isn't ideal, but you can use it on your lap. There's also a dangling piece of fabric for an apple

95
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,280
pencil. So if you have an apple pencil, that's great. If you don't, not so great. The case is lighter

96
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:02,400
than the rugged, but more bulky and heavier than the apple keyboard. For me, it truly comes down to

97
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,680
the apple keyboard or logitech's rugged folio. If you're looking for a super lightweight keyboard

98
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,120
that also doubles as a protective case, then go with the apple keyboard. It feels great to type on

99
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,840
is versatile, sleek, and super compact, and you can easily fit it anywhere, just like in my

100
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,560
backpack's iPad slot. Oh, and if you like this backpack, I did a whole review on it and you should

101
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,360
check it out because it literally is amazing. So click that right there to see it. Now if you want to

102
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,520
heavy-duty case with lots of different angles and it's a little bulky, but you don't mind that,

103
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,400
then go with the rugged folio. Just know, the case is going to double the weight and triple the thickness

104
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,600
of your iPad. What it comes down to is I recommend you having a keyboard for your iPad,

105
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,440
what started out as an iPad keyboard review in comparison really turned out to be like an iPad

106
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,120
workflow recommendation. I love the way that the iPad's transform my workflow and just the ability to

107
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,400
have a super lightweight workstation with me, and I truly believe that anyone who only needs a limited

108
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,640
amount of apps and abilities on their laptop can really get away with using an iPad. And yeah,

109
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,160
the only downside here is price. They're a little expensive, but I think that they are a great investment

110
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,439
and what I'll do is I'm going to be updating the links down in the description over time as they get

111
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:20,000
cheaper in price. So be sure to check those out. There you guys have it. That is my iPad keyboard

112
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,120
review in comparison video. I hope you guys enjoyed it. If you guys have any keyboards that you love,

113
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,520
let me know in the comments below. I want to try them out. Anyway, I've got a lot more videos coming

116
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:56,640
Is the zoom right? Yeah, tell me zoom in. Movie magic. I'm not this tall.

117
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,680
All right, let's get the next shot.
