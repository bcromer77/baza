1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Explain to us what Glucotrack looks like.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,360
The device is housed in a titanium housing.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,600
Again, design just like an implantable loop recorder.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,640
And so the length of that device, about two thirds of that length,

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,920
is actually battery to give us, you know,

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,280
three-year longevity out of that remaining one-third,

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,240
you know, half of that is electronics.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,640
And then the other half, which is the clear plastic part,

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,160
you know, at one side of the device,

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,600
that is where we connect the lead.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,160
And then the lead is kind of like that little sensor filament

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,440
that comes out of the sensor, or the, you know,

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,519
and it has, you know, wires that go down a connects

14
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:45,080
into the device, as wires go go down to electrodes,

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,160
as constructive, very similar to a cardiac pacemaker lead.

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,600
It goes into the actual vein, which is sort of near the armpit area.

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,640
And then it's advanced to inches or five centimeters

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,240
into the subclavian vein.

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,360
And the lead goes there, and then it is, you know,

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,599
sutured down and connected to the electronic device,

21
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,280
which is placed effectively under the skin.

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,440
If I'll go as well, you know, our target is, you know,

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,680
commercial approval in, you know, second half of, uh,

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,680
2028.
