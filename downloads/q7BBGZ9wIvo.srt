Hey guys, so Philips, you just announced a ton of new products and I got to get a first look and I was really surprised. Let's check them out.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Philips, you invited me over to check out a bunch of new products coming out this fall and I've got to say it was lit.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's start with my favorite new bulbs, the filament light bulbs. They are beautiful and look great in lighting fixtures with an exposed bulb.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
All three will be available in October. Besides light bulbs, Philips use also coming out with some other smartphone gadgets.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So here's one of them. It is the Philips Hue button.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There it goes. It has a magnet. It gets magnetized right there and then it stays. I was not ready for that.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The button may look simple but it can do a lot. With one press, you can control your lights however you like.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Or you can press and hold to brighten or dim the lights.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
When connected to a bridge, you can also configure the button so that it turns your lights to a preset shade of white light and brightness.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That suits that time of day.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm really excited that Philips is decided to come out with their own smartphone.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We've been wanting this for a while. I just a simple button like this and we got it. It comes with a piece of 3M tape that you can then put on it and then you can stick this thing anywhere under a table.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Anywhere other than that.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The button will be available in October.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Another one I'm super excited about is the Philips Hue Go.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So the original came out in 2015 and now it is even better because for a few reasons they brought the Bluetooth technology to it.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So it literally is a Hue Go. You can go anywhere with it. I only go camping with it.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It will connect to your Hue Bridget home but also you take it anywhere you want and you have that Philips Hue Bluetooth out and you can control it from there.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's got a great button on the bottom that you can program and put it to a bunch of different settings.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This thing can last anywhere up to 18 hours depending on its use. Pretty awesome.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The Hue Go will be out for all of your camping needs in November.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Last but not least we have the Philips Hue Smart Club.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Finally Philips Hue has come out with their own Smart Club.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That way you can keep all of your lights even those ones that aren't Philips Hue bulbs in the ecosystem.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So you can connect any lamp with this thing and it will be in that Philips Hue home.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Super excited about that.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Along with these, Philips has also announced the each 12 candle bulbs and the GU10 Spotlights.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
These are available this month.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The best part is that all of these products besides the button have Bluetooth.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Meaning you won't need a bridge to start out but don't fret the button will work without a bridge using Zigbee.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll be testing out and reviewing these products soon.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So if you're sure to hit that subscribe button and press the bell for alerts.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Also if you liked this video why don't you give me a thumbs up and let me know in the comments which products you are most excited about.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Philips Hue they're coming out with the ton of new products all the time.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
They really care and I love that.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I also care about you guys and that's why I'm doing a cute little giveaway of the Philips Hue Go.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Justin and I'll take you later.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000

41
