00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Hello, everyone, and welcome to this episode of Just In Tech.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,840
Unfortunately, I do not have any technology for you today.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:13,120
I also may not be wearing any pants, but I have a very exciting announcement.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,320
I got my first.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,680
Hey, comment. Yay, first. Hey, comment.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,080
Bring it on. Bring it on.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,920
I think many people would be upset by this, but I'm really excited.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,640
Because if I got to hate comment, I think that means I'm doing something right.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,600
And I just want to thank Mr. Art Wilbur so much.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,400
I really appreciate it, because it just makes me feel so good.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,200
Mr. Art Wilbur says, fix your f*** up mustache.

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,280
It's blinding.

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,600
It's literally all I could see in this video.

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,640
So Mr. Art Wilbur and the world, I have a confession to make.

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,200
I have a mole.

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,120
Done. Done.

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,280
Yes, it is true. I do not have a f*** up mustache.

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,320
I have a mole on my lip.

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,680
My mom and I like to call it Beauty Mark.

20
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,080
This isn't the first time I've gotten this comment before.

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,920
I've had people be like, oh, you're mustache.

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,880
And I'm like, oh, no, that's a mole.

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,640
I'm like, oh, okay, I'm so sorry.

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,200
This comment also brings up a lot of memories from elementary school.

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,120
The movie Gold Member came out.

26
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,440
This movie literally ruined my life.

27
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,280
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,640
Don't say mo, I said mo.

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,720
Mo, le, mo, le, mo, le, mo, le, mo.

30
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,840
It ruined my 5th and 6th break experience.

31
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,960
Maybe 7th, too.

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,160
Mo, le, mo, le, mo, le, mo, le, mo, le, mo, le.

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,680
It's actually not funny at all.

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,680
I wanted to write a letter to the producers of Gold Member.

35
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,720
It was that bad.

36
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:45,400
Mr. Art Wilbur, Gold Member, the world, I am so proud of my mole.

37
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,280
It is who I am and I've come to embrace it for a long time.

38
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,440
I wanted to get rid of it.

39
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,000
But you know what, imperfection for me is beautiful.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,399
I don't think anything about my mole is ugly.

41
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:00,679
I think it's special and I embrace it and so should you.

42
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:04,240
If you have any imperfection, it's who you are and it's what makes you special.

43
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,039
That is all I wanted to say today.

44
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:09,600
No technology, just me and my mole have a good one.
