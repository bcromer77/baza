00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
This is the Colido 2 Insulin Pump, and it was just unveiled at ATTTD, and I want to tell you everything about it.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,760
The Colido has been known to be a colorful pump, and this one isn't any different.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,280
There are six colors to choose from, and I think they're a bit more mature. There's more of a matte finish on these.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,240
I kind of like this better. The Colido Pump is a two pump, and it can be worn in a few different ways.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,560
You can either have a long tube and put Colido in your pocket, or you can adhere to your body and use a short five-centimeter tubing,

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,200
and infusion site that goes in right next to it.

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,200
The original Colido was already small, but this one is even smaller, about 10% smaller,

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,200
and it is the smallest rechargeable hybrid closed loop pump.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,880
Colido 2 uses the same infusion set as Colido 1. There are a couple new sensors in here.

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,080
There's an accelerometer, which could theoretically be used to track activity,

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,280
and there's also a temperature sensor. So maybe that means it will be able to let a user know

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,000
if the insulin could be getting too warm. Another improvement has come to its charger.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,240
It now uses USB-C. Love it. This pump is still in development, and the company hopes to submit

14
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,120
CE Marks of Mission next year, and is aiming for the pump to release early 2027. In Europe.

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,920
After that, the company's main focus is getting this pump to the United States,

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,880
and getting FDA clearance. I'll definitely be keeping my eye on this pump, and as I hear updates,

17
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,600
you'll find out on my page. So follow this page for more diabetes tech tips and news.
