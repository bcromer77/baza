00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
Hey it's Justin and today I'm in Palm Springs and I got a house because I'm going to need

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,520
this space.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,960
Welcome to the second video of my magic leap video series.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,800
This episode is all about being social on the magic leap one.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,120
I'm always looking for ways to be able to share what I'm seeing on my headset with others.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,880
And today I'm going to show you some of the ways you can communicate, collaborate, and

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,040
be co-present using the magic leap one.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,200
I just didn't have to go on.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,360
Throughout time we've had advancements of communication from the telegram to video chat.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,920
And now with this headset we've reached co-presents or the ability to put the people

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,480
you're talking to there in the room.

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,840
All of the apps I'm showing you in this episode, you can use right now on the magic leap

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,840
one.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,120
And I think you're going to be impressed.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,120
Alright, it's time for me to do my favorite thing.

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,120
Talk to people.

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
Let's go!

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:01:01,760
I want to start off with a bang, and that is the space she ate app.

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,480
What this app does is it makes your entire room a canvas, where you can draw 3D art and move

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,040
around your space.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,360
Lifting your left hand displays your palette controls, where you can choose color, shapes, and brush

22
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,360
strokes.

23
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,800
Your right hand has your tools.

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,320
There's a free stroke paintbrush, a straight edge paintbrush, and a eraser, and a six degrees

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,200
of freedom wand grabbing tool, where you can pick up drones and change their size.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,600
You can also save your art and open it later.

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,360
You can invite up to 11 other people into your room to draw art together.

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,480
So right now I have my friend Max over in LA, we're going to meet him, and space she ate.

29
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
Hey Max!

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
Oh, Justin!

31
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
Hey!

32
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,240
Space she ate synced Max's art over to my room, and I was enveloped by his lost angels scenery.

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,160
Could you help me put up a billboard I've been meaning to do?

34
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,880
I would love to.

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,880
Do you need help with it?

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,600
Well, it's actually to advertise the best YouTube channel I've ever watched, Justin underscore

37
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
tech.

38
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
What is that?

39
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
I've never heard of it.

40
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
That's weird that you haven't.

41
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
It's yours.

42
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,000
After some terrible acting, we started our collab.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,640
The billboards bigger than the Hollywood sign, and it deserves to be.

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,600
You know what to be even better Max?

45
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,800
What if we did this in the same room?

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Is that even possible?

47
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,079
Ah, it'd be great to go to the city, even for a couple of hours.

48
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:14,800
Let me see if my old trick worked.

49
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
3, 2, 1.

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,300
Oh my goodness!

51
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,860
Every room mapping, Space She ate could detect that we were in the same room, and it

52
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,740
was even more fun to collaborate.

53
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,740
Oh, it's good.

54
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,620
And for your friends who don't have a headset, they can join in on the fun by getting the Space

55
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,340
She ate app on their smartphone.

56
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,340
They'll be able to view the artwork and use all of the same tools right from the app.

57
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,740
The Space She ate mobile app is now in beta.

58
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,020
Next, it was time to test this even further, and host a Space She ate happy hour.

59
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:47,020
So right now I'm in Palm Springs, California, and I have three magically team members over

60
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,020
in Florida, in my living room right now.

61
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,020
Let's go say hi.

62
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,020
Hey, Joe.

63
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,020
Hey, what's up, man?

64
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,020
Hey, Joe.

65
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:59,020
My living room was filled with people, and to my surprise, Steve was also joining us from San Diego.

66
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:04,020
Everyone was strong their own unique creations, and some even collaborated on a piece.

67
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,020
Oh, we can make a peacock.

68
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,020
I think a bunch of feathers.

69
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,020
That sounds interesting.

70
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,020
I got here, I'll start.

71
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:13,020
I watched as there 3D Drong came alive, and look at how pretty it came out.

72
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,020
Now in Space She ate, you have to let the art do the talking.

73
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:23,020
But if you want to have a more intimate, animated experience, that's when you try out avatar chat.

74
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,020
In avatar chat, you can invite up to five others to hang out.

75
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,020
Unlike Space She ate, you can customize your avatar to fully express yourself.

76
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,020
There are so many different attributes you can alter, but the one key thing missing are moles.

77
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,020
Come on, magically.

78
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,020
Help me out here.

79
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,020
So right now, I have Tay from magically in the avatar chat.

80
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,020
Let's go say, hey, Tay.

81
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,020
Hey, Tay.

82
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,020
Hey, how are you?

83
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,020
I'm great.

84
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:53,020
The app supports a plethora of user tracking, which allows for more emotion to be conveyed.

85
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,020
Avatar mouths move when you talk, and there's eye tracking.

86
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,020
So when you blink or roll your eyes, people can see.

87
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,020
There's also hand tracking.

88
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,020
You can make a thumbs up or other moves using your non-remote hand.

89
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,020
You can also cast landscape apps like Helio and Gallery to share with others.

90
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,020
And developers can even build more landscape games for avatar chat.

91
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,019
So I hope they begin to introduce more fun things that I can do in here.

92
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,019
So at this point, I've shown you two apps that are unique to the magically headset.

93
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:25,020
But there's another one that you can use that you're probably already using.

94
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,020
And that's Google Meet.

95
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:33,020
Just start a video chat from the Helio web browser, and you can connect with others who are on their phone or computer webcam.

96
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,020
So it looks like I'm standing in your kitchen right now.

97
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:42,020
But in fact, I'm in my office in front of a black backdrop, and the N01 effectively subtracts that.

98
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,020
It literally looks like they're in your room and can walk around freely.

99
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,020
And even cook in your kitchen.

100
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,020
You can also move them around, change their size, and put them on your countertop.

101
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:57,020
This is a great tool for connecting with friends and family, because anyone can access Google Meet on their

102
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,020
phone or computer.

103
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:05,020
Also, the person you're speaking to can see what your headset camera sees, so this tech could be a great remote assistance tool.

104
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,020
That was so corny, I love it.

105
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,020
Up until this point, I've really only used virtual reality social apps.

106
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:17,020
But after using the magically one, it just felt so much more natural using social apps in my own space.

107
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,020
And I'm not alone.

108
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,020
Every one of my friends who play these apps never wanted to stop.

109
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,020
I think it's incredible where we are now.

110
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:30,020
But with the introduction of faster internet speeds like 5G, the sky's the limit with this technology.

111
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,020
What would be a deal maker for you for social apps in spatial computing?

112
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:40,020
I can think of a bunch of things that I want to be doing with my friends using this co-presence technology.

113
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,020
Let me know the comments below some ideas, and I still have a lot of magically videos coming out.

116
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:57,020
Alright, I've got to go enjoy this pool, so I'm Justin and I'll take you later.

117
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,020
Wait, go see there.

118
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,020
Okay.

119
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,020
Oh, look, I'm giving you.

120
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,020
Yeah.

121
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,020
Hold on a second.

122
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,020
Looks really pretty.
