1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Diabetes is a lot to take in, especially after diagnosis.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,920
The flood of new terms, tech, and lifestyle changes can feel totally overwhelming.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,000
It's like being dropped into a game with a complicated tutorial.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,440
And you're expected to beat the boss battle on day one.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,360
But what if I told you there was a fun and intuitive tutorial available right now to help

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,360
with diagnosis?

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,720
Well, a new smartphone app called Level 1 is aiming to be just that.

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:36,860
A fun game-ified way to make Type 1 diabetes education easier to understand for newly diagnosed

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,760
patients and their families.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,760
Welcome to the show.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,760
I'm Justin.

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,760
I have Type 1 diabetes in on here.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,760
I talk all things.

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,800
Diabetes tech, news, and research, and I am a gamer.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,239
So I got super excited when I heard about this app, and I played it myself.

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,520
Today I'm joined by Sam Glassenberg, a veteran video game developer, and father of a child

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,840
with Type 1.

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,280
And that's what inspired him to make this game.

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,560
He created Level 1 to help others navigate the early stages of diabetes management through interactive

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,080
levels that teach everything from insulin to car ratios to how exercise and fatty foods affect

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,080
blood sugar.

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,080
Health care providers and patients are already raving about this app, and now it is available

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,840
to everyone on the app store, whether it's Google or Apple.

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:29,000
And after playing about 10 levels myself, I can confidently say that I wish I had this app when

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,440
I was first diagnosed.

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,120
Keep in mind that this show is not medical advice and it's for educational purposes only.

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,440
Always consult with a physician before making changes to your health care.

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,440
All right.

29
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,440
Let's get into it.

30
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,440
Sam, welcome to the show.

31
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,440
It's good to have you here.

32
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
No.

33
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,440
Great to be here.

34
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
Thank you for having me.

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,200
So little thing about me that you may not know is that I almost went to school for video

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,720
game design at Northeastern, but it was a last minute decision to not, and I'm glad I didn't

37
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,800
because then I probably wouldn't be where I am today.

38
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,960
But I love video games.

39
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
I'm a gamer.

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,360
I'm playing last of us part one right now, which I'm really enjoying on my PlayStation portal.

41
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,360
Yeah.

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
Gamer to gamer.

43
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,000
I want to hear all about the work that you've done, but before we get into Level 1, tell

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,080
me a little bit about your background and how you, you know, I guess your background

45
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,480
in video game design.

46
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
Sure.

47
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,720
So I've spent my career in video games.

48
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,200
My first job was out of college was at LucasArts.

49
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
I was hired as an animator.

50
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,320
I flew spaceships for cutscene animations in PlayStation to Star Wars games.

51
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,120
After that, I used to run a game technology team at Microsoft.

52
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,040
I built a company that did games for Hollywood movies, Hunger Games, Mission Impossible,

53
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
Rocky.

54
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,040
And for the last 10 years, I've built a company called Level X, which actually makes video games

55
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,520
for doctors.

56
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,440
Very cool.

57
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,880
I think what I love about video games so much is that they test you, they push you, you need

58
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,320
to use critical thinking to get through puzzles.

59
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,440
It's not as relaxing or as simple as watching a movie, right?

60
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,200
They put you to the test.

61
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:25,799
So I guess why would you say video games are a good tool for teaching and learning?

62
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:28,680
They are the best tool for teaching and learning.

63
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,120
Humans have evolved to learn this way.

64
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,959
I mean, think about it, when you get a phone or anything, you don't read the manual.

65
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,280
I don't even think they've even come with manuals anymore.

66
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,560
You go, I need to play with this.

67
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,880
Why is this?

68
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,920
We have evolved to learn through play.

69
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,040
And in the video games industry, we have kind of figured out that neurochemical recipe.

70
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,920
For exactly what you describe.

71
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,600
How do you hit the right balance of reward and frustration, challenge and skill to keep you

72
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:04,720
in the flow state and literally maximize the release of neurochemicals in the brain to maximize

73
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,080
fun, but also maximize learning.

74
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,760
Happy to like, I have a lot of examples, sort of the neuroscience of angry birds and things

75
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
like that sort of explain.

76
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Give us that example.

77
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
That's a cool one.

78
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
I love angry birds.

79
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Oh, yeah.

80
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,040
So if you've ever wondered why angry birds are so addicted, I mean, people, the game came out

81
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
10 years ago.

82
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,720
I still see people playing it on airplanes today.

83
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,120
We've evolved to play angry birds.

84
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,680
What do I mean by that?

85
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,600
So just a thing back to the first time you play angry birds probably a while ago.

86
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
What happened?

87
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,240
Angry birds hops in the slingshot.

88
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,320
You aim at the tower of pigs.

89
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
You fired.

90
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,480
What happened the first time you played?

91
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,440
I killed some pigs.

92
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,440
Not the first time.

93
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,440
The first time you missed.

94
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
Yes.

95
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,040
And what happens when you miss the piggy's laugh at you?

96
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
Why?

97
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Why?

98
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
Why?

99
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Why?

100
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,039
Why?

101
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:55,039
Why?

102
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:56,039
Why?

103
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,039
This totally gratuitous.

104
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:58,039
Why?

105
00:04:58,039 --> 00:04:59,039
This makes you frustrated.

106
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:00,039
Second bird hops in.

107
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:01,039
You aim a little better.

108
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,039
You fire.

109
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,039
You get closer to the tower.

110
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,039
But you still miss.

111
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:06,039
And you get more frustrated.

112
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,039
Third bird.

113
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,360
There's glorious.

114
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,480
There's explosions and animations and the pigs go flying in the music changes.

115
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,880
All of this, all of this, was deliberately designed to trigger a dopamine release in your

116
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,560
brain that reinforces those neural connections used on that last successful fire.

117
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,160
This is why.

118
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,560
An hour later, you're firing that bird between two narrow obstacles at 50 meters.

119
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,760
And like 80 hours later, you're still playing the game.

120
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,200
Now, we didn't invent this, we didn't invent this in our mechanic in the games industry.

121
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,240
It's existed in the mammalian neuron for tens of millions of years.

122
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,159
This is how our ancestors learned how to throw a spear.

123
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:48,480
Miss, miss, miss, frustration, frustration, hit, dopamine.

124
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,440
Okay, what are the neural connections we used on that last successful throw?

125
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,320
We want to make those thicker.

126
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,159
We're going to want to use those again.

127
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,640
In video games, like what's Angry Birds doing?

128
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,960
It's training your brain, how to predict the flight, the parabolic flight of an angry bird.

129
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
What's seem city doing?

130
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,640
It's training your brain to understand how a city works.

131
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
It's level one doing.

132
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,719
It's training your brain, how to manage diabetes.

133
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:09,719
Yeah, yeah.

134
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:17,880
I've played Angry Birds in so many different forms from iPhone, back in maybe that was 2014.

135
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,159
And then I played in VR and I even played in augmented reality with the magic leap headset,

136
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:28,159
which was a really cool way to experience it because it's like you put an Angry Birds game

137
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:32,120
on your table and you're playing Angry Birds in your space, which is cool.

138
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,280
Box would fall off the table and hit the floor.

139
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,880
This was really high tech stuff.

140
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,120
And I actually talked all about that on just in tech, which was my, what I was doing before

141
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,200
diet, that tech, which was all technology and it was a lot of fun and I love tech.

142
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,200
I love gaming and that's now a more private part of my life, which is nice.

143
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
It's not my work.

144
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,560
I get to do diabetes, which is my work now.

145
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
For me, I'm very lucky.

146
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
It's both.

147
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Yeah, right.

148
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
Right.

149
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
It was amazing.

150
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,080
We actually, back, you know, level X for, for, for doctors, we have like, we built some

151
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,360
bunch of the launch medical content for magic leap and AR core and AR kid and a bunch of these

152
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
things.

153
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,520
So we have, you know, you can, you can do spine surgery, you know, on a spine that's floating

154
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,800
and you can actually just do it with the controllers.

155
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
It's crazy stuff.

156
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Yeah.

157
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,640
If anyone is interested in seeing, I did a whole five part series with magic leap and talked

158
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:30,599
about all the cool experiences and apps for it were, and the technology still holds

159
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:31,599
up.

160
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,760
Like it was very advanced at the time, so it's kind of like now is when it's all kind of happening

161
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,120
especially with the Apple Vision Pro.

162
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,360
So I'll throw that in the show notes.

163
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,880
Your company level X, you, you design games for doctors, tell me a little bit about what those

164
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,000
games are and who they're for.

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,599
So look, the, like, what level X does is they said, make games for medical professionals.

166
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,000
So if you think about, so imagine we would really have millions of medical professionals playing

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,920
video games to, you know, they're earning continuing medical education credit toward renewing

168
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
their medical license.

169
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
They play games.

170
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,840
We have, when you think about diagnosing rare disease, that's a puzzle game.

171
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,680
When you think about managing a complex patient with multiple comorbidities, that's a strategy game.

172
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,920
And so we basically bring in the top game developers, designers, artists who worked on everything

173
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:29,320
from mortal combat to diner dash, we team them up with hundreds of physician advisors across

174
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,920
every major therapeutic area in medicine to, we say, advance the practice of medicine through

175
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
play.

176
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,920
To use video game tech and video game design to help accelerate the adoption of new techniques,

177
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,920
new products, and that's, that's what we do.

178
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,720
Now we, with diabetes, have expanded also into games for patients.

179
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,320
Yeah, you told me you had to convince your parent company to let you do this.

180
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,320
Tell me why, why, why that was so important to you.

181
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,120
So this is the, this is sort of the story of how level one came about.

182
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,120
In the middle of, you know, I'm halfway into the level X journeys, five years ago, my at the time,

183
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,320
five year old daughter was diagnosed with type one.

184
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:17,920
And the onboarding experience was not great.

185
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,520
And so on Friday, your life is normal.

186
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,120
And then within 24 hours, oh, hey, Sam, you thought your job was running video game companies.

187
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Oh, that's your second job.

188
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,960
Yeah, primary job is you're now a pancreas and you need to inject what is a lethal drug in

189
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,760
insulin into your kid and to precise don't precise doses, you know, dozen times a day.

190
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,560
I call it like this one sheet, I call it the guide to not killing your own kid.

191
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,360
We're out of the hospital in 48 hours, because my wife's a pediatrician, she caught it early.

192
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,360
And we're out of the hospital.

193
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,760
They give us a, here's this thing.

194
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,960
It's got scribbled out carb ratios, insulin sensitivity factors, you know, all this guidance on how to

195
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:10,160
prebull, it took me a year and it took us a year to actually develop a mental model to understand

196
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,960
how to manage this disease.

197
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
Finally, after you're like, oh, I get it.

198
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,560
Yeah, insulin curves and action curves and digestion speeds.

199
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,960
And, okay, now my brain knows where that curve is going to go.

200
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,360
And I was like, well, this is stupid.

201
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,560
Like, why should you have to do this?

202
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,560
We're learning, we're learning how to manage diabetes through play.

203
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,360
But the play is trial and error on your own kid, or for many other people, it's on themselves.

204
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
This is terrible.

205
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
So we fixed it.

206
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:46,560
I put together a design and at the time, so level actually been acquired by a major medical device company

207
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,560
and, you know, called BrainLab, they do, you know, all the cool, like, neurosurgery hardware

208
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
and software.

209
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,560
But they also do a lot of philanthropic efforts in health care worldwide.

210
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,560
And I was like, hey, this is super important to me.

211
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,560
I want to get this game done and they fund it to their credit.

212
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,560
And so we built it and launched it two weeks ago.

213
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,560
This episode is sponsored by OmniPod.

214
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,560
As someone with T1D and with an incredibly active lifestyle, it's important for me not to get tied up,

215
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,560
especially with tubes on my insulin pump.

216
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,560
I love to go swimming, lift weights, and play kickball with friends.

217
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,560
And with OmniPod 5, I never have to worry about tubes getting in the way.

218
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,560
Plus, not having to disconnect helps me to stay in range during all of my favorite physical activities.

219
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,560
That includes sexy time too.

220
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,560
See if you're eligible for a 30 day trial by visiting OmniPod.com slash dive tech.

221
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,560
On there, you'll see full safety and risk information and trial terms.

222
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,560
That's OmniPod.com slash dive tech.

223
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:53,560
So I can imagine as a parent, like, it must be really stressful to have to learn all of this new information

224
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,560
when your child's diagnosed and have to manage their pancreas.

225
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,560
I mean for me, it was so overwhelming.

226
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,560
It really did take that full year to feel like I got all of these different areas of diabetes down.

227
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:11,560
And I've always looked at my diabetes as a really annoying game.

228
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,560
It really is a game of, like, add a little of this.

229
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,560
Reduce a little of this to keep you in this range.

230
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,560
Like, like, flappy bird, right?

231
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,560
Or that this helicopter game I used to play, which was essentially flappy bird.

232
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,560
And I can just imagine someone like you, you were immediately as you were taking all this information,

233
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,560
like, game of fighting in your brain a little bit.

234
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,560
Tell me a little bit about these early days of when you were doing this.

235
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
How you were thinking about all of this.

236
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,560
I mean, I'm sure it was so stressful, but like, were you already kind of toying around with things like,

237
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,560
Oh, this is like, game of fighting in your head.

238
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,560
So not yet at the very beginning.

239
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,560
What's interesting is, so first off, I hardly remember the beginning,

240
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,560
because you don't sleep much when you're the parent.

241
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,560
But what I did was actually wrote it down, and I wrote a little bit of a diary,

242
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,560
because what was interesting was not like thinking about it from the perspective of like,

243
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,560
how would I make a game to solve this?

244
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,560
I wasn't there yet.

245
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,560
But what was interesting for me is coming from video games.

246
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,560
We've gotten extremely good at, there are all these rules around video game design.

247
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
How do you make a game fun?

248
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,560
How do you bring people into a video game and introduce them to the game such that,

249
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,560
because obviously there's a thousands of games launching in the app store like every month.

250
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
So how do you make it?

251
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,560
So your game stands out.

252
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
So people start playing it immediately.

253
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
They start having a good time, and they get into it.

254
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
And it's engaging.

255
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,560
And there's all this neuroscience and design to do this.

256
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:42,560
What I realized was the experience of type one diabetes takes all of those rules around how to make a fun and

257
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:51,560
thralling, captivating video game, and flips them all in their head to make the most punishing experience possible.

258
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,560
Little things like, there's rules and video games.

259
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,560
You always want to give the player an early win.

260
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,560
So you notice when you play a new game.

261
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Usually there's some little thing you do, and it's like, oh, congratulations.

262
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,560
You just beat a boss.

263
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,560
There's some early win.

264
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,560
Diabetes, the exact opposite.

265
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,560
Also in video games, it's very important that player understands what they're being scored on,

266
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
and what that score means.

267
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
So type one diabetes.

268
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,560
You start already you're losing.

269
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,560
If you're, you know, luckily we're in in D.K.A.

270
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,560
But like, you know, blood sugar is 550.

271
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,560
You don't even know what that means.

272
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,560
Like, keep a little bit of anyone's, you don't know what that means.

273
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,560
All you know is you have a score.

274
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,560
Your score is bad.

275
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,560
And the score is really important for gameplay.

276
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,560
And then from there, it's just all downhill.

277
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Like the, you know, whether it's the instruction manual, which is terrible.

278
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,560
Whether it's the, you know, all the different we call the loops of

279
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,560
fingerpokes and injections.

280
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,560
And it's all, you know, so I actually wrote a blog that I, you know, eventually posted,

281
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,560
called worstgameever.org that literally just goes through this sort of day by day as a game,

282
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,560
you know, from a game design perspective on why the onboarding experience is terrible.

283
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,560
I wrote it because it was therapeutic for me, but a lot of other parents have been reading it

284
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
like early on.

285
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,560
And they're just like, well, it's great to know that others were sufferers.

286
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,560
Other sufferer like you do.

287
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,560
Yeah.

288
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,560
You know, I'm a pretty competitive person, not a sore loser, but I like to get super competitive

289
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:22,560
about games and I like games where you can, there's like real strategy to being good at it.

290
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,560
And yes, diabetes, yes, their strategy.

291
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,560
Yes, there's different features and modes you can turn on and adjustments and

292
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,560
preparation you can do, but no matter how good you are at the game of diabetes,

293
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,560
it will always school you in a way you don't expect.

294
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,560
You cannot perfections impossible.

295
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,560
It just is.

296
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,560
We, because we move and we eat and we breathe.

297
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,560
You know, it was like doing what there was something like doing the same thing,

298
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,560
the eating the exact same thing and doing the exact same thing for three days

299
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,560
and getting completely different results, that's what type one diabetes.

300
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,560
And so in video games, that breaks the rules because in video games you always

301
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,560
want the player to know how their actions correlate to their score in the game.

302
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,560
And you want it to be consistent and diabetes is not that.

303
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,560
So even when we designed level one, like one thing that was very important is you can

304
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,560
three star any level without a perfect score without being in range the whole time.

305
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Because it's very important that first few days to really internalize like

306
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,560
perfection is impossible.

307
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,560
Don't try it if you try it, you will actually just stress yourself out because you can't.

308
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,560
As long as you're within range 90% of the time, you're happy.

309
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,560
You can three star every level and level one because our whole thing is do not like,

310
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,560
you know, how do we literally create a game that trains your brain like,

311
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
no, no, no, you don't want it.

312
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,560
You don't need to be perfect relax.

313
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,560
So it's a really pretty looking game.

314
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,560
I know that you were inspired by different art types of games.

315
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Tell me a little bit about, you know, the inspiration behind the style of the game and

316
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,560
what the game style is.

317
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Yep.

318
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,560
So the, there's the mechanics and the visuals.

319
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,560
The mechanics, we call like the gameplay.

320
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,560
Super simple.

321
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,560
You play the whole game just with one thumb.

322
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
One handed one thumb.

323
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,560
We don't want you to have to spend an hour learning out of play the game.

324
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,560
We want you to know how to play the game intuitively and spend your time learning how to manage diabetes.

325
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,560
The game is a particle, fundamentally a particle puzzle.

326
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,560
It's a particle game.

327
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,560
If you've ever played feed meat oil, where's my water,

328
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,560
a world of goo?

329
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,560
Like, these games are played by a billion people.

330
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,560
They're super fun.

331
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,560
You have thousands of particles on screen that interact in interesting ways.

332
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
It's gorgeous.

333
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
Our brain delights in it.

334
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
That's why we love playing with sand.

335
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,560
And that's why humans love playing with water and magnetic sand and things.

336
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,560
Because we delight in complex particle interactions.

337
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,560
So the game is just gorgeous.

338
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,560
And what you're doing is in the game.

339
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,560
You're also, it's also a rhythm game.

340
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,560
So if you're familiar with like, I think,

341
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,560
guitar hero is that genre.

342
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,560
So what is dosing diabetes?

343
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:04,560
It's, you know, making sure to time your doses with whatever's going on with the food with your current,

344
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
with your current blood glucose level.

345
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,560
And so the game is just like it's super simple to play.

346
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,560
All you're doing is tapping with your thumb, dosing insulin.

347
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,560
Once a while if you go low, you move your thumb a centimeter to the left and you dose some juice.

348
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,560
And the game just represents everything.

349
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,560
So there's 60 levels.

350
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,560
There's food that's just moving in on a conveyor belt.

351
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,560
Dropping into your digestive system.

352
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,560
Getting broken down to these gorgeous glucose particles.

353
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,560
You inject insulin.

354
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,560
It comes in off the side.

355
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,560
Activates the cells and just sucks in the sucks in the glucose.

356
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
It's gorgeous.

357
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,560
It's captivating.

358
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,560
The visual style is super light and casual.

359
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,560
Kind of think candy crush.

360
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,560
Because we really wanted to make something that was going to be,

361
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,560
you know, a visual style, like everyone plays candy crush.

362
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,560
So we picked visual styles that are like very casual, very friendly.

363
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,560
You're usually already under a lot of stress when you're trying to learn about this.

364
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:05,560
So the whole theme is just very the soundtrack is very zen.

365
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
And you just play the game for two hours.

366
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,560
And you've mastered every major topic that you need for the first six months of MDI.

367
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,560
Yeah.

368
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,560
It's a really pretty looking game.

369
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,560
And somewhat relaxing playing it.

370
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:24,560
Like you can take in all of this information and enjoy yourself and not feel like two stressed.

371
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,560
Sam.

372
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:32,560
So during development, how are you making sure that what you were doing was correct?

373
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:39,560
Like were you working with other people, doctors, HCPs to play levels and things like that

374
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,560
to make sure that the information you were putting out was correct?

375
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,560
Yes.

376
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,560
So this is level X is what we do all the time.

377
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
Right.

378
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,560
So we work with hundreds of physician advisors and contributors.

379
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,560
We have biomedical engineers and MDs on staff.

380
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,560
So because obviously you're making games for doctors, it's going to be.

381
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:03,560
So we know how to make really games that are accurate and that are peer reviewed and so forth.

382
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:09,560
We started out, you know, with obviously all the publications, the peer review papers,

383
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,560
around, you know, insulin action curves and glucose and, you know, all the glucose dynamics.

384
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
So it's modeled after real science.

385
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:24,560
But then, of course, we ran a beta for, I think, over a year, we're not a year, where we had hundreds of endocrinologists,

386
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,560
diabetes, educators, camp counselors, newly diagnosed parents, everybody.

387
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,560
And we're just internalizing all the feedback on the game.

388
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,560
Just like you would in any game, you know, make sure it's balance but also make sure that it's that it's not only,

389
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,560
like, medically accurate in terms of the glucose behavior.

390
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:48,560
But even just making sure that, like, all the messaging and all the, you know, we weren't doing anything.
