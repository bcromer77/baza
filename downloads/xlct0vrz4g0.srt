00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
I am here at Sequel Medtech Headquarters in Manchester, New Hampshire, where eight employees

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,280
are starting on the Twist Insulin Pump.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,480
Let's check it out.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,880
Employees gathered to celebrate the launch of the new pump, including the CEO, Alan Loppin,

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,480
and Pump inventor, Dean Cayman, almost 30 employees around the country started the system

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,480
today.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,920
And I spoke with Jen LeBlanc, one of the first people to use twist.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,360
You've been wearing this pump for four hours now.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,360
Four hours.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,360
How's it feel?

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,360
It's absolutely incredible.

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,360
I've never had a pump like this, and so you can see my glucose alert.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,360
Look at that.

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,360
What are they coming in?

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,360
Bulletin on the watch.

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,360
That's something I haven't had a chance to do on my other systems before.

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,360
So I can't tell you how excited I am.

18
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,360
Everybody's here from every single person.

19
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,360
That's going to be answering calls for people with diabetes.

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,360
That's going to be working on the product.

21
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,360
It's going to be training.

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,360
Everybody's thrilled.

23
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:58,360
In just two years, the company was built, brought on over 250 employees, and launched twist.

24
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,360
And sequel says it's just the beginning.

25
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,360
Their motto is never settle.

26
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,360
Support for two continuous glucose monitors has already been announced.

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,360
A second infusion set is with the FDA, and more updates are planned.

28
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,360
The twist pump is coming.

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
Sequel Medtech is cranking these out.

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,360
I went over to the production line, and they are hard at work.

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:27,360
