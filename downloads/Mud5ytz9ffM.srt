1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
I'm here with La Ura and we are doing a Moby site change. Okay, I knew that you wanted to try this so I was like

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,280
Well, why don't you guys to show you?

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:16,080
This is the the cartridge for it. It's tiny. What we'll do is I'm so excited. You're gonna take this and then you're gonna put the insulin

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,480
I'm gonna hand it in the top. Wow

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,800
Yeah, that's you see it going and you think I can see it also from this side. We got it. Yeah

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,880
Good job

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,680
Okay, I did it. All right look at this

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:38,600
Put that down and push down there you go now the cartridge is on now look at I mean look at how short that tubing is

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,960
That's five inches. I don't know what it is in the years. I think

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,160
10 centimeters

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:53,280
10 centimeters and that is the one I would love to use actually with Moby with Moby. It's always interesting to hear different people's viewpoints

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,360
I mean everyone is not really yeah, we may have one different things. Yeah, so that's that's good

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,040
Which is why it will never work

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,840
us

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,280
Yeah, of course we will always find something like that because we want different things

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,280
Exactly, actually we want the same thing for diabetes to be cured

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,320
Type yeah, is that it is that where you go?

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
Oh, there it is

19
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,560
Insulin now it's ready for me to insert so I think all I'll do this. Okay, and I'll put

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,280
There I know what to do don't worry

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,680
Well, you're okay, bro

22
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,440
You're faster at this than I am because I just started this

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,360
Did it hurt? No, I never feel it just put it in my eyes. Let me see yeah

24
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,640
Oh, nice so I put this in there. Well, you know it's in there. I mean it's not impossible and then okay, and you clip it there

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,280
I'm just gonna put it right there

26
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,680
This is what it is look there's my inside it. Let me put my mic on that

27
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,720
And that's that

28
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,720
I'm wondering when I will be able to do it

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,320
And maybe next year next year next year
