00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In many ways, we are living in a golden age of diabetes technology, from smart home control, customizable alerts,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and some of the smallest, sleekest and most accurate continuous glucose monitors and pumps we've ever seen.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But back in the early 2000s, that golden age felt light years away.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's when Amy Tendridge, one of the very first diabetes patient bloggers, wrote an open letter to Steve Jobs.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In it, she called out how clunky, outdated and user unfriendly diabetes tech was,

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and asked for help, bringing it closer to the sleek intuitive design of the iPod Nano.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
While Steve didn't write back, that letter sparked something big.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It launched Amy into the world of diabetes innovation,

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and eventually, letter to create D-data exchange events that bring together leaders from Pharma companies,

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the FDA, advocates, and DIYers to share ideas and accelerate progress in diabetes tech.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Welcome to Diabetic, I'm Justin, I am Type 1 Diabetes,

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and on here, I talk all things diabetes tech, news, and research.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Today, I am talking to Amy about what it was like being a voice for patients before social media,

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
how the we are not waiting movement got started, and how D-data has grown into one of the most impactful spaces

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
for innovation in our community.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And this June at ADA in Chicago, I'll actually be moderating a panel at D-data on GLP ones,

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
so we will also get into how these kinds of conversations are shaping the future of diabetes care.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Keep in mind that anything you hear on the show or any of my platforms is not medical advice,

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and it's for educational purposes, only always consult with a physician before making changes to your healthcare.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Amy, welcome to the show, it's great to have you here.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Thanks for having me.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Of course, so we recently connected, and I thought it was so interesting how much of an overlap,

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
kind of your origins and what led you into all of what you're doing,

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and then mine and what I'm doing, so this is going to be a cool conversation.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm hoping to learn whatever you've learned over the years and then be able to use that.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So thank you to that.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Thanks for saying so I agree.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm surprised that we hadn't crossed paths earlier, but of course you were much more newly diagnosed than me,

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
but we had a similar path and that we have a background in covering technology, right?

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And then we get this disease that's very tech-heavy and can really benefit from innovation.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So I guess that if you have to get a chronic illness, it's kind of an interesting one to have.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah, I think it's for me it's been so fun to be able to use the skills that I've gained over the years video production journalism reporting,

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and then be able to do that for something that affects me directly,

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and then be able to use that expertise and lived experience with everyone else,

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
which is kind of what you've done, tell us a little bit about your background in tech journalism and kind of how you entered this whole industry.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Well, absolutely agree with what you just said.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And I'm always saying that, like, that so many of us advocates kind of,

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
we bring to the table whatever skills we have and what our, you know, background is.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So some people do sports, ventures, you know, other people do policy lobbying from the government.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I like you have a background in covering technology.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm from a journalistic side and doing research, media research,

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and I also had a pretty strong background in event organization.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So when that came into play, that was a way for me to help connect people in the community,

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
bring people together, you know, and have these forums that hopefully are a catalyst for change.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So so my background is I have a undergraduate degree in journalism,

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
a graduate degree in communication studies and media,

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
and I was actually working as a technology journalist when I got diagnosed in 2003.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It was right after the birth of my third child.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And I was told that I had, you know, somewhat high blood sugar,

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
but I didn't, you know, I guess prior to the baby being born,

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
but I assumed that that was a gestational and it was going to go away.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No one told me any different.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So when the baby came, I started losing weight like crazy and sort of had a classic, you know,

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
crash into the hospital.

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I was there for like 10 days.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I was, you know, going into DKA, the whole thing.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It was really rough because I had a five year old, a three year old,

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and a five month old baby.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And was sort of rubber stamped as a type two because of my age.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And just because I just, so I, you know, even I knew there was something wrong with that

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
because I was, look like I had just been liberated from a concentration camp.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You know, I was so like depleted.

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And so very quickly it turned out that the Orals they put me on were doing nothing

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and then I was put on insulin, but in this very primitive way with this literally,

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
like printed out paper that had some kind of sliding scale.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And I was in the honeymoon phase, as you know, the beginning where I really didn't need a lot of insulin.

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So I was having then lows all the time.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And this is what led me to say, I can't live like this.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I was having two and three severe lows a day.

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I was afraid to get in the car with my children.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And I thought, I just, I'm, you know, I got the resources.

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm a scrappy journalist.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm going to figure this out and I started to research it.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You know, just like I would any other topic.

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And then eventually, like year and a half and after my diagnosis is when

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
blogging sort of came onto the scene.

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I know that sounds super OG.

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's very old school nowadays, but literally that was the birth of blogging.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And I just had the idea of my husband and I actually encouraged me to start this blog

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
where I would sort of chronicle my own experiences and then also put on my journalist hat and

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
you know, do some like reporter on the street stuff.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And I'm sure, as you know, just in like, you get so many press releases and sort of official announcements.

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And at the time, again, it was just the beginning of social media.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That's really all there was.

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So, you know, you've got your Rose sending you like, oh, breakthrough and diabetes.

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You know, there's close to a cure and, you know, look at this device and look at that.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And you don't really know what's what and whether anything really is going to have an impact

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
on your life.

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So I think my original idea was like to help people sort through that and look behind these press releases

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and say, what is this device?

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Is it really available?

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
How much does it cost?

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What would it be like to wear it?

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You know, who else is working in this space and really dig into it?

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But we also at diabetes mine, which was my blog.

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
My personal blog that grew into this established publication.

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
We also covered, I mean, we did a lot of technology coverage,

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
but we're also sort of a general, you know, we did feature stories and interview,

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and fun contests and just sort of, it was like sort of all things diabetes.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We called it a diabetes newspaper with a personal twist.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But I'm really happy that I focused on the technology side of it because that's what got me all involved

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
in this innovation initiative.

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And in this world of, you know, getting to meet all these amazing developers.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah.

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's funny.

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I mean, similar thing happened to me where I was misdiagnosed as type two.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And then I was somehow diagnosed with type one.

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Thanks to the community on TikTok, which was my platform where I connected with the community.

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And in all the platforms I'm on, I'm almost on this like new generation of blogging.

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yes, there are substacks and people are still writing.

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
In fact, I have a blog, but this new generation of blogging is very video related.

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What was it like to be in there in the early days of blogging for the type one community?

113
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, I mean, just patient blogging, you know, all together was this new thing.

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So one of the ways that diabetes mine became so well known is that early on there was a journalist at the Wall Street Journal, Laura Landro,

115
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
who was diagnosed with cancer and she decided to sort of chronicle her own experiences in the paper.

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
She did this feature story that was on like the front page of the health section or something about patient bloggers.

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It was like, oh my gosh, these people are like creating their own publications and they're writing all these stories.

118
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And she featured me in my blog very prominently in that story.

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And it just got all, you know, really helped me.

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This quantum leap in visibility and all these people who came forward and said, this is really cool.

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So it was really fun.

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I have to say, there were about five or six of us in the beginning.

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
There was a small, I could count them on one hand, the people who were doing diabetes blogs.

124
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We all knew each other.

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We had all these primitive tools in the beginning.

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I forgot what it was called, but it was related to the original blogger app.

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This sort of roundabout thing where you could list other people's blogs, like links to other people's blogs that are related in the same area.

128
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And then people could cycle through and see all the blogs.

129
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You know, now that would be impossible because there's probably thousands of them at the time, you know, we were a small group.

130
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So we really felt like we were, you know, on the ground floor of something and there was all this excitement.

131
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And all of this warmth I would say in camaraderie, like we all just wanted to help each other.

132
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You know, that's one of the unfortunate things about when the social media sphere exploded and grew.

133
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's become a lot more contentious and, you know, also a little bit harder to navigate because there are just so many people doing so many different things.

134
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But, you know, in the early days, it really felt like this, you know, really core community.

135
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And we were super excited when, eventually, there were some in-person events that we got to meet each other in real life.

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
How did your blog evolve?

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Because, and I'm very curious, because as mine moves directions, you kind of just follow the current of what people like and what they want.

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What did you notice from conception to kind of, as you grew, the different directions you were moving in?

139
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Well, one thing is, I mean, you know, I think I'm being honest to say that I was one of the few people who was actually a trained director.

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
who was actually a trained journalist who was doing this, so I was writing these stories.

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm literally covering the developments coming out of the med tech industry.

142
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And, you know, thankfully they paid attention and they were respecting what we were doing and we were kind of like a trade publication.

143
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So, you know, people like Kelly closest group, a diet tribe, they're, well, you know, close concerns and diet tribe.

144
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
They were always like pointing people to ask things, this is a great source.

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And this is if you want like a patient perspective on these new technologies, you should look at them.

146
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
At one point in this was very early on.

147
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I remember we had done a story about, I think it was lifespan that had done this supposedly PSA, but it was really basically a marketing pitch and we kind of dinged them on it.

148
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And the post that what we had done about that, you know, kind of criticizing their marketing was getting more traffic than their actual website.

149
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And that's what the industry started paying attention and they're like, oh my god, you know.

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's, it's funny you say that because today I posted an article about Dex comes 15 day sensor and how hidden in the press release all the way at the bottom it says that 26% of these sensors don't last the full 15 days.

151
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So I wrote a whole article.

152
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah, well, I think they had to maybe, you know.

153
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That's kind of stuff we would do. We would pull out and say, hey guys, you know, lagging this, did you notice this?

154
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
There was also early on, I think it was by Ada when that first came out.

155
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The drug, you know, the injectable drug that we had basically posted something and said, you know, there's this new drugs.

156
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Only certain people are trying it might have been simlin, which is related by Ada.

157
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
In any case, we asked people about, you know, their experiences.

158
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And then we got hundreds of comments and it became kind of the de facto like user form.

159
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I mean, it was interesting to see how bloggers them got on these pitchlists for, you know, all the PR agencies and all of the industry folks are reaching out to us saying, do you want to do an interview with our CEO?

160
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We have new, you know, new technology. So it really was like running a daily daily newspaper at that point.

161
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You know, and they were, you know, there was a lot of, I would say, considering they wanted to make sure they were getting good coverage.

162
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But we were, you know, very candid. I mean, that's the fun thing about being a blogger.

163
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's very immediate and you don't have a lot of controls. There was no, you know, hierarchy to tell me we can't do something.

164
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
As the community grew, it got more and more well known. I also then personally ended up doing a lot of sort of side prod, like additional projects.

165
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So, you know, besides being so it was kind of interesting. I'll say this. I even wrote some stuff for the ADA's magazine early on.

166
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And then later, you know, we were doing some posts and at some point they contacted me and said, like, are you a freelance writer for our magazine?

167
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Or are you being this, like, independent blogger who's criticizing stuff we're doing? And I'm like, look, those lines are blurring you. You know, I can be bald. I mean, I, you know, I'm just being.

168
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:54,000
They blur for me, too. They blur for me, too, because I take, I take sponsored projects. It's one of the ways I make money. But if one of the companies I work with

169
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:04,000
does something that is newsworthy, I need to report it just because that's kind of the job I have. And something that you did that

170
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
really caught my ear when you told me, you told me you wrote a letter to Steve Jobs. This was in 2007.

171
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:22,000
2008. Okay. And it was about the state of diabetes. And one line stuck out to me was you said medical device manufacturers are stuck in a bygone era.

172
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
They continued to design these products in an engineering driven physician centered bubble.

173
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Tell me a little bit about why at that time it felt important to write to what the seat was either CEO of Apple.

174
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes. So that was really the post that kind of changed my life and started this whole thing. And in fact ended up leading to this. We're not waiting monitoring, which is amazing.

175
00:13:48,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But what basically happened was I was already gripping, you know, privately to my husband about how poorly designed some of these or, you know, clunky and hospitalish a lot of our devices were at the time of my diagnosis.

176
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So in 2008 I want to say it was spring of 2008. Apple was doing this big PR push about the 100,000 iPod being sold.

177
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And like, oh, this is amazing. And I remember this is actually happened. I was in a dark pub or something with my husband and was trying to take my blood sugar with an old school finger sick meter.

178
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And it was really dark and I couldn't really see this green and I was struggling with the little strips and this and that.

179
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And I was like, these things, you know, it's just so ridiculous. You know, I mean, we have this insanely great consumer technology that someone thought to backlight, you know what right when in this album, you know, and these insulin pumps and these things that were wearing our body.

180
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So I think the, you know, so I wrote this open letter to Steve Jobs, which was basically saying, hey, we need the gurus of consumer technology designed to get together with these people in medtech and start making this stuff better. It should be keeping pace with consumer technology. We know it's possible.

181
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Meanwhile, you know, the industry, the medical industry at the time, still considered their customers to be clinicians.

182
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So when they were designing an insulin pump, for example, they would take it to clinicians and say, is this thing clinically viable.

183
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But at that time, there really was no effort or at least no like organized effort to, you know, have people who are going to live with these pumps involved in the innovation and the development.

184
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I mean, at most what they were doing is they would totally design something and then they would have a focus group and they would put some people in a room and see what buttons they push and see whether what, you know, what are they struggling with.

185
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But that's not the same as, you know, co-designing alongside your users, right. So that was really a big point of it.

186
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And I was, you know, shocked and delighted that it got so much attention. And all these people came out of woodwork and said, you know, I've been saying this all along, including some people in industry, including some folks at the Stanford Bio Design Department, who I ended up later working with.

187
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And then, you know, it, it, it actually got picked up in TechCrunch, the, you know, Michael Airington's technology.

188
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So through that, then it kind of ricocheted around and we, there were stories literally in like the Chicago Tribune and the Financial Times and in magazine, all these things picked up on this idea of patients pushing for better design of devices and also for being involved in the innovation process.

189
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So what, then what ended up happening was we were so inspired by this that we had the idea to do this open innovation competition to we called the Diabetes Mind Design Challenge.

190
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah, so we got inspired to actually put out a call to patients, you know, and we're engineers, thinkers, anywhere who had an idea to improve life with diabetes.

191
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So basically it was if you have an idea for any kind of product device, gadget or even a service that would help people live better with diabetes, we want to hear about it.

192
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And I was able to get a grant from the California Healthcare Foundation, so we had really substantial prize money for it.

193
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The JDRF, who I was kind of close with the leadership at that time, they were excited about it, they put out a press release.

194
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And that, you know, obviously really helped and then we got all these sort of luminaries in the diabetes based some clinicians and some researchers and some folks in industry to be the judges.

195
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And ran this thing off of the blog, we ended up doing it for four years in a row and it was amazing.

196
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I did a lot of outreach to universities, which was a really cool thing, just to get young people involved.

197
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And to me, like so many of those concepts have come to market now, like touch screens and all sorts of things, not necessarily in the exact same format that they were submitted to the contest, but many of those ideas are here now, but one of the big wins to me from that was kind of getting this next generation of thinkers involved.

198
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So giving an example, the woman who won our contest in 2009 was a graduate student at Northwestern University and she was in a design program, she did not necessarily have any thoughts about going into the diabetes industry, but she was very inspired by winning the contest and then I was able to introduce her a bunch of people.

199
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And she eventually hired at Medtronic in their next generation in some pump group.

200
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So it was like, yeah, that's really cool. We're getting, again, these younger people who are used to Apple products that don't even need a manual because you just, you know, it's intuitive, right?

201
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
As opposed to the stuff that we were still dealing with.

202
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Did Steve Jobs respond or did someone from Apple respond?

203
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:45,000
No, no one from Apple directly responded, but there were several design firms, including a fairly well known one of the United States that came forward and said, you know what, this is really cool.

204
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
We were looking for a pro bono project. So we want to, how can we help?

205
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And so I worked with them in their process of researching what would be sort of a next-gen product.

206
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
They came up with this thing called the Charmer, which is like the word Charmer without the E, just Charmer.

207
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And it was, it was a design, they made a prototype of this little combination CGM in some pump, which did not exist yet at the time.

208
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And it was, it had a touch screen and it was a little thing that you put on your, it looked like a charm. You put it on your keychain and it had a little touch screen that you could lock.

209
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And they literally, they made all this prototype and all these designs of it and they took it around to these UX design events around the country and kind of show that off as a really cool idea.

210
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So, you know, so that was, I think a really great way to manifest, like, this is the type of thing that we're looking for.

211
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
This episode is sponsored by OmniPod.

212
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:51,000
As someone with T1D and with an incredibly active lifestyle, it's important for me not to get tied up, especially with tubes on my insulin pump.

213
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I love to go swimming, lift weights, and play kickball with friends.

214
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And with OmniPod 5, I never have to worry about tubes getting in the way.

215
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Plus, not having to disconnect helps me to stay in range during all of my favorite physical activities.

216
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That includes sexy time too.

217
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:16,000
See, if you're eligible for a 30 day trial by visiting OmniPod.com slash diabetic on there, you'll see full safety and risk information and trial terms.

218
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That's OmniPod.com slash diabetic.

219
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You were just about to say before, this innovation challenge kind of morphed into this next generation step in events that you were hosting, right?

220
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
So that was digital, then you kind of moved into more in person.

221
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Correct. So it was 2011.

222
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And the rise of social media was the big thing happening, right?

223
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Being able to meet people from all over the country, super exciting.

224
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But we also, again, I was living in the Bay Area working with Stanford, and we said, well, you know, there are a lot of people here locally who are very involved in innovation and development.

225
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Maybe it would be a cool idea to have an in person event.

226
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
As many people as we could get, I mean, from at least from around California and maybe further to come together and have this sort of leadership.

227
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
This very candid though, you know, kind of gathering.

228
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Where I said, listen, I've got to, you know, I've got to network now through my reporting of, you know, a ton of people in the industry, a lot of entrepreneurs startups.

229
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And also this growing community of advocates who had really big followings, you know, people who are just doing really interesting stuff.

230
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Plus the national advocacy organizations, ADA, TDRF, you know, beyond type one was in Iran yet, but they came later.

231
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You know, so I just knew all these people and I said, we could get them together in a room and have, you know, this kind of next generation.

232
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Different kind of gathering where they can really, you know, cross-pawn in ideas and talk about, you know, what are the current challenges and what works for everyone.

233
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:58,000
So the first, we called it the Diabetes Mind Innovation Summit and it was at Stanford in the fall of 2011.

234
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The very first one was actually a workshop that was run by IDO design.

235
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't know if you know them, they're very well known.

236
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Design firm, they're based in Palo Alto, they work a lot with Stanford and they also are a bit in healthcare.

237
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
They now work a lot for Eli Lilly and other companies, but they basically ran this kind of ideation workshop.

238
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So we had patient leaders sitting next to people from FDA sitting next to people who were like, you know, head of global distribution from a big farm.

239
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:33,000
A red tech company, like all these, all these different, and those days we actually used to create, like, table, you know, seeding arrangements so that each table had a good mix.

240
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So it wasn't just like all the patients sat together, right? We wanted people to cross-pawn.

241
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah, that's great.

242
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So we did this and it was very well received.

243
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I have to say in the very beginning, the industry, people were kind of reticent to come and they're like, you know, I can't disclose what my company is working on.

244
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Or I don't know if I can be sitting across from someone who's my, you know, competition.

245
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I said, look, we're not asking anyone to reveal their IP or anything.

246
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And just talking about like bigger challenges, you know, what needs to be done, patient needs, et cetera.

247
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Anyway, it was very successful.

248
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And then we did that for another year and then in 2013, that was also when tide pool came on the scene.

249
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And if you know, those guys, and I key, I was reporting on them as a sort of this cool diabetes startup and that was also a nonprofit.

250
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And, you know, went to Howard Luck, who's the CEO and said, hey, I'm thinking that I, I'm hearing about all of these kind of individuals out there who are very technology savvy, who, you know, are engineers, many of them.

251
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
There are many of them, there are many of them parents of a child, the type one, who are starting to tinker with this stuff and create their own solutions.

252
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And they're reverse engineering, the protocol and the dexcom and they're making all this stuff.

253
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I think it would really cool to have some kind of hub for those people.

254
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So we decided we're going to do this pre-day to our big summit and it's going to be called the diabetes mind, D data exchange.

255
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And the type of guys they co-hosted with me the first couple years.

256
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
But so we thought, you know, okay, we're going to do, we got a classroom across from the big hall in the Stanford School of Medicine.

257
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And we're like, well, I have 20, 25 people from the Bay Area.

258
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And ended up being like a standing remotely, like really excited, you know, we were over fire code, we had way too many people in there.

259
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And everybody was buzzing.

260
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
The first one was just like a big show in town, like everybody got it, everyone who's there basically got up and talked about what they were working on.

261
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I want to hear more about who was there.

262
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Lane Despero, who you may know, who was, you know, launched, he was within electronic for many years.

263
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
He's launched several startups, brilliant person. He was actually the one.

264
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And then, of course, Howard and some of the original folks from Typool and then, you know, some of the people who ended up being behind,

265
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
you know, big foot and beta bionics and all of those, like, you know, original folks.

266
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
There's kind of a core group of diabetes dads, you know, who were there.

267
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You, you, you would told me that there were different areas of the industry that you wanted to bring together, right?

268
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So one thing that happened was the next day after the first diabetes mind you didn't have seen.

269
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
We asked Howard to give a little summary of what happened the day before.

270
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And we had sort of at the end of our little meeting we're like, what do you guys think? What is coming out of this meeting?

271
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And I think I'm pretty sure it was Lane Despero, who originally said, like, it feels like we're not waiting.

272
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
We, you know, and then we talked about that. What does that mean and everything?

273
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And then Howard presented that the next day and then that became sort of the mantra.

274
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And as you know, grew into this like whole movement that represents DIY diabetes developed.

275
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So we are not waiting started in that room.

276
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Yes, well, the, yes, the same.

277
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
This moniker of yes, the moniker, the hashtag, you know, this sort of name for this movement definitely came out of it. Yeah.

278
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Absolutely.

279
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I mean, so that's, you know, that's why D data still has this, you know, our core is bringing together the patient entrepreneurs patient innovators with the, so the powers that be.

280
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So basically what happened is we said, okay, this is amazing bringing these people together.

281
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:19,000
We need to combine this with our other summit because the whole idea is to bring these patient leaders and patient developers together with all the other groups that I've talked about, right, researchers, clinicians, decision makers in, you know, large advocacy organizations, diabetes educators, you know, all of that group regulators, we needed to bring them all together.

282
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:27,000
So, you know, every, and also we said, okay, you know, technology changes so fast, we're not going to wait a whole year to do another meeting.

283
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So ever since then, we started hosting the D data exchange twice a year. So June, we did it wherever ADA is having their big scientific sessions.

284
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
We're obviously reasons, everybody's in town.

285
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So you do it like a half day on the Friday kind of before ADA kicks off.

286
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Now over the years Friday is also a busy day for people, but I've never had problems with people attending D data.

287
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
They want to be there and then they go on and do ADA for the rest of the weekend.

288
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Yeah, I went, I went to the one at the ADA last year and it was so inspiring to be in a room full of people from all these areas of the industry.

289
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Many of faces that I know, people who have come on the show.

290
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And then just all the presentations hearing what people are working on and even hearing from a representative from the FDA, talking about what, you know, what it looks like from that end, which is not something we always get to hear.

291
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
That was an eye-opening experience.

292
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Are there any stories that anyone's out told you about, like, I went to your event and met this person and we were finally able to connect and make something happen.

293
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Absolutely.

294
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Absolutely.

295
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Because it's not just like, let's have a fun event.

296
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's literally amazing, tangible things come out every single event. I just blows me away.

297
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I have people, so early days, so many people in the DIY community were getting hired by all these companies because they would come in and they'd give a presentation and they'd need people.

298
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And, you know, Dexcom hired up a bunch of people, Typle did, you know, my sugar at the time, you know, so there was a lot of that happening.

299
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:10,000
But literally, I mean, over the years, I can't even tell you how many people told me, like, we launched a pilot project, we were able to put together an advisory board.

300
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You know, we're doing a collaboration with this company.

301
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Our group is providing a bunch of beta testers for this new app.

302
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You know what feels so important to me about this event. And we've touched on it.

303
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:36,000
But it's like, the we are not waiting community has pushed forward so many features and abilities way ahead of their time, at least on the FDA level.

304
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And being able to put people that are innovating that quickly without guardrails in a room with the people who understand the guardrails and are constantly navigating them and want to push forward by can't.

305
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Putting those people together and potentially having a conversation about how they can work together feels just so important. Can you speak to that?

306
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Well, first of all, thank you. You put that so well.

307
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And it's totally, I mean, that is totally, for me, the lifeblood of this, like, why we do it.

308
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
You know, we talked originally about like, how we bring our skills to it. I mean, I'm not an engineer. I'm not a developer.

309
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm a huge fan girl. And I know how to describe this stuff, obviously, as a journalist.

310
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But like, what I can bring to this table is hopefully facilitating what you just said.

311
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Trying to bring these people together to have meaningful connections and, you know, accelerate things.

312
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And, you know, it was in the very beginning when the DIY systems are really new.

313
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
There were people say, how can you have, you know, someone up there talking about that when there's FDA people in the room.

314
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I said, well, this is the world that we're in. Like, they need to know this is happening.

315
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
No one's going to say to that person, the one individual is sitting there like, you need to decide right now, whatever you're going to do with this, right?

316
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:55,000
But then eventually, so you may remember during the reign of Courtney Alias and Stacey Beck that they were super open

317
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
and had a couple of FDA sessions with the patient community.

318
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And, you know, we're really, I think, you know, really interactive with the community.

319
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
They came to my event.

320
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I don't know who they, I don't know who those people are, tell us.

321
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
People who were kind of heading up the diabetes device reviews some years ago.

322
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Like, right around the time when the AI systems were coming to market.

323
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Like, the first ones were coming to market, which was originally artificial pancreas.

324
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And they, I feel like we're pioneers in, you know, helping FDA really listen to and embrace, you know, patient input.

325
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And again, they were very involved in my event.

326
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
They came many times. And, you know, that was another thing where they were like, thank you for getting us in front of these people.

327
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
We met a bunch of people. Now, they're doing all these different initiatives.

328
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And I know they worked with the diet-tripe foundation and did some, like, webinars and stuff.

329
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So, yes, but you're absolutely right. It really is, you know, it's not a CME event just to like get some kind of certification or anything like that.

330
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
It's really, you know, this is like, let's stir the pot. Let's be catalyst for change.

331
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Let's get the right people in the room and have really good conversations about what are, you know, what's new and hot.

332
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
What are the barriers? You know, what are the challenges? How can we get past those things?

333
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
How can we make sure that everything is being developed is really in the interest of patients,

334
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
you know, which, but then there's no reason that companies can't profit off that if they make a good product, right?

335
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And so... Well, that's also the goal of the we are not waiting community.

336
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It's not for them to come out with the features first and keep them to themselves.

337
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:37,000
They want FDA cleared systems to take their ideas and implement them into the devices so that everyone can, you know, have those features and live a more free life.

338
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
That's the whole reason these people in their free time, they are, you know, working on these projects.

339
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:58,000
It's not to keep to themselves. These are many selfless people that are spending this free time that they could be spending with their families or themselves playing video games to create better algorithms that people like you and I can benefit from.

340
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:06,000
The reason that I'm still going home on always putting patient innovation at the forefront is like I think it's illustrating the unmet needs, right?

341
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It's showing the industry like, here are the things that we still want and need that aren't out there exactly the way you said.

342
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:27,000
We hope that you will pick up on these ideas, right? And again, I always say, why are these people taking their own personal time and effort and money in many cases to do this stuff because they, you know, they have a passion and they feel that they've come up with a solution that's going to help relieve the burden of diabetes.

343
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And, you know, and you're right, let's get it in front of the right people and hope that they do pick up on the ideas.

344
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:52,000
In your last few meetings, what are the trends that you're starting to see become really popular in that we are not waiting space that FDA clear systems are picking up on and, you know, working on bringing in themselves.

345
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
So are you asking specifically about like what features in AI systems or just overall what topics are hot?

346
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But kind of whatever, whether it's an actual feature or something that's something in due or trends that you're seeing like AI.

347
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:18,000
AI, I was going to say, hey, it's going to be AI, right? So we did all, you know, obviously AI is changing the world and it has an impact on everything from, you know, a nutrition app to, you know,

348
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Gosh, we have things like a safety, one of the demos we're going to have at the upcoming event is a safety device for people to type on whether driving, which is AI driven.

349
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You know, AI's ability to dig into data and actually, you know, get insights from that, you know, the way that AI is helping clinics to identify the patients who are most in need and, you know, kind of contact them at the right time with the right information.

350
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I mean, it crosses all everything. So, you know, we did a whole big section on it and it's just obviously something that's now running as a thread through everything that we discuss.

351
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:10,000
The other, well, another big, currently really topical issue is GLP1 therapies, as you know, and you know, it's one of the few things that has become so huge outside of diabetes while it also has a huge impact within diabetes.

352
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And really is just like sweeping the nation in the world right now and the, you know, in the world of type ones, there's a struggle going on to how do we get this covered because these are really the people whose lives could be so, you know, transformed and not just because they're going to lose weight.

353
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So, you know, obviously that's a really big topic and then we talked about in some of our last couple events, you know, this sort of adjacent therapy. So if you could use, you know, the inhaled insulin alongside an AID system or could you use a pump alongside, you know, a GLP1, you know, what happens when you combine these therapies and you know, what does that look like.

354
00:34:47,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And then, of course, the, you know, one sort of background ticker tape that's always running through everything we discuss is access, right. So we, I'm aware, we are aware that, you know, these are cutting edge innovation events and that we've got like some of the probably countries top people, you know, minds and people with resources who are creating stuff and the question always comes, you know, how are we going to get this out to the most people who can benefit from it.

355
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:26,000
What about cost is this going to become like a concierge thing where it's only available to the most elite people, how can we avoid that, right. So that's a topic that is that never goes away, right.

356
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Yeah, and then, you know, we've been closely monitoring the development of obviously sensors and AID systems over the years. And I'll say it was 2019, we had sort of the very first ever closed-loop system showcase where we had six of the companies that were creating these AI, what we now call AID systems.

357
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Some of them were still, you know, pretty early, I would say, but for every single company or organization that was building one, we had them talk about what they're doing and then we had patients come in and talk about what it was like to actually use the system.

358
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And some of those patients were in trials at the time. So, you know, that's the kind of stuff where we're like, you know, what is cutting edge we want to hear about it and we want to make sure that we tap into the lived experience of people with diabetes.

359
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Today's episode is sponsored by T1D Exchange. You can directly make an impact on diabetes health care, treatments, and technology by participating in the T1D Exchange registry.

360
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:35,000
It starts with the simple survey about your life with T1D, and it only takes about 15 minutes. After that, you'll have a personal portal with ongoing T1D study and survey opportunities.

361
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Plus, some of these studies even offer compensation. Signing up with the link in the show notes helps support my channel and it allows me to continue putting out free content.

362
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:52,000
You can sign up at t1dxchange.org slash diabetic or click that link in today's show notes.

363
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:01,000
After the years of throwing this event, is there something that you're most proud of?

364
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I guess, I mean, being able to say that I was there at the, you know, ground zero of this we're not waiting movement and, you know, helped at least help cross-pollinate and bring people together and foster that.

365
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It's just so exciting. And I mean, I still every day see stories coming out of, you know, the UK and other countries about, but we were not waiting, like it's this thing and I'm like, oh, that was me. I was there.

366
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Well, you know, so that's a great thing to know that you're a part of that. And also, I mean, I'm just going to say, like, you probably feel the same way.

367
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:39,000
It's no one wants to diabetes. It's a shitty disease, but doing the work we do, you get to meet so many amazing people.

368
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I feel like I've, you know, this, this community just never ceases to blow my mind, you know, there are so many great people out there.

369
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And, you know, it was easy, early on to think, well, the farmer and the men take people or the enemy or they're just, you know, out there for corporate greed.

370
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
But there are so many good people in those organizations who, you know, many of whom live with this disease themselves or have a child.

371
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And they're really there for the right reasons. And, you know, knowing that it gives me hope that, you know, despite the challenges we're all facing that people are, you know, pushing in the right direction.

372
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Yeah, when you were in the room and you came up with this, you all came up with this, we are not waiting.

373
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Did you understand the gravity of that at the time?

374
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Interestingly, I mean, there was no, you know, how could we possibly know it was going to sweep the world? No.

375
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But we did, we just whole list. And I have it somewhere, like, in our original materials of, like, we're not waiting for what? And we went, like, there was this whole manifesto that went with it.

376
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
We're not waiting for the FDA. We're not waiting for the, you know, for the industry companies to do it.

377
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:50,000
We're not waiting for, you know, it just, it was like a whole description. We thought, you know, we had to have this really, like really well thought out manifesto.

378
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And it turned out just like that hashtag and that mantra, you know, you could just take it and run, like people got it. They knew what it meant.

379
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And, you know, so, you know, again, it felt exciting. It felt like we were definitely on the ground floor or something big.

380
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:15,000
But there was, there's no way to really, you know, preview how, how just like, you know, what a, what a world change or this is going to be, right?

381
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Yeah.

382
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
What do you think we are not waiting for right now?

383
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
That's a good question. We asked, I feel like we asked that every year, my event, we're like, okay, what is going on?

384
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Yeah. And really, that's how we choose the topics. In fact, we're like, are, I have these two key questions we ask, like, what is the D data community buzzing about right now?

385
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And, you know, what are, how are these new emerging challenges being met?

386
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And we use those as kind of guideposts to pick our topics and speakers and stuff.

387
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So, you know, I mean, does, you know, it goes back to sort of what's hot right now. So, maybe what we're not waiting for right now is, you know,

388
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:00,000
how could we get GLP ones covered, you know, and approve for people to type one. Like, come on man, let's, let's not wait on that. Let's do it, right?

389
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
A lot of people are having success there. They're using it all label and, and yeah, we need more information there.

390
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:20,000
More, yeah, and I mean, so the, at the upcoming event, which is going to be in June in Chicago, we are for the first time ever going to be showcasing self therapy innovations, which hasn't normally been sort of our bellywick.

391
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But the reason that we're choosing to do it is I feel like we're at this inflection point where there are a lot more players in the space, there's a lot more tangible evidence.

392
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:37,000
There are obviously more people who've actually undergone these, these self therapy treatments, and who can talk about the impact on their lives, and it feels like it's really getting somewhere.

393
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So, that is an innovation that's sort of up and coming.

394
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
We're not waiting for a cure. Let's do it.

395
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Thank you. We're not waiting for a cure. You know, and how can we push ahead and how can we push on access so that more people, you know, would be eligible to get this life changing therapy, right?

396
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Is there anything that over the span of blogging in that growing into these, these events? Is there anything that you've learned from this whole process that you wish you could go back to like your earlier self when you started all this and say like, hey, do this.

397
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Or like, you know what I mean?

398
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I mean, it is blessing and a curse being so independent and being kind of a one woman show because I feel like if I, you know, there's a lot of things I should have kept track of and like early on.

399
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I didn't even have a good system to keep talking about my own network. I just knew so many people and it was like, oh my god, where's their phone and where's their email?

400
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It sounds kind of primitive, but it was like, just so busy doing the everyday work, you're like, oh my goodness, I should have database of people.

401
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:50,000
So I feel like I didn't, it took me a while to realize like I need some infrastructure, you know, in order to like sustain this, you know, so it would have been nice to be able to hire an assistant.

402
00:41:50,000 --> 00:42:04,000
But yeah, I think, you know, keeping records of stuff and also like some of the best stuff we did online, you know, over the years the blog was acquired not once but twice.

403
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And you know, the internet's fickle and time goes by and then some of our best coverage, you know, sort of disappeared from public view.

404
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So we just recently gone back and doing this archive project and trying to kind of reclaim those articles from back in the day, you know.

405
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Do you have any advice for me? Like how how I could potentially better use the platforms I have, whether it be my podcast, my YouTube channel, my social pages, my blog, which I've re I launched maybe like six months ago when I love blogging it's so much fun.

406
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And then my newsletter like is fun too, it's a lot of work, it's all a lot of work.

407
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:56,000
So I mean, I'm not to sound like, you know, Granny who knew it was by a certain thing, but one thing I would definitely say is like, you know, do your homework, look trying to find out what, you know, how are look used to say every time he would come and talk about.

408
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And he's like, we're standing on the shoulders of giants, you know, there's this, you know, this core group I happen to be part of that laid the ground where for all this stuff, there's a lot of people out there doing stuff.

409
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And I mean, I think it's great, you know, if you, because that's what I did to I came in and I said I'm going to interview all these people like, oh my god, there's someone who wrote this book who's someone has this really cool website like I'm going to highlight their work, but there are so many people, especially like young people with like an idea for a startup or some app.

410
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Who will come to me and say, I want to show you my pitch, my really cool thing and I look at it and I say, well, do you know, there's already three other apps that do this or how is this better than what someone so is doing and they're like, what?

411
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Like, did you do your homework like that, like, who's, you know, in their cases who's the competition, but like finding out what else is out there and what's been done, I think is really important so that you have some like institutional knowledge to, you know, to stand on, you know, and then other than that, I mean I think, you know, you're doing it just right in the sense that like people.

412
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:04,000
People love the personal kind of product review, whatever, unboxing or let me look at this thing, you know, you know, with the visuals, that's amazing.

413
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And if you can get somewhere from the company to come on and talk about it, like, why do you guys build it like this, what about this feature, have you thought about that, you know.

414
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I think, you know, that's magic.

415
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:21,000
So I would definitely say like, you know, just keep connecting with as many people as possible and you know, whenever you hear about someone doing something cool, like see if you can get them on your show.

416
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Well, and that's that's been my favorite thing about having this show is especially to the point where it's grown.

417
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:44,000
People want to come on, especially when I approach them, I mean they approach me too, but you know, if I think something's cool or I have questions about something I want people to come on and I'm just because you're the founder CEO of the company that makes the device doesn't mean I'm going to ask you a silly question like, you know, I don't love that you put your.

418
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
You know, logo right on the middle of it, you know, I'm just going to tell you exactly how it is or ask the questions, you know.

419
00:44:50,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And it's a difference between being like purposely contentious and, you know, trying to stir up the pot and then just being like constructively, you know, curious and and, you know, critical to be, you know, so for example, the ever since when it first came out, it was like, oh, it's so cool, you know, it's.

420
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
It's inserted and I'm like, yeah, but you got to wear this thing on the outside to make it work and it's black.

421
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I don't want to black blah, but I mean, I did I wore it and I wore it when it was only three months. So I got the scars to show for both shoulders.

422
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Do you regret getting it with this for the scars or no, you're glad you did it.

423
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Okay.

424
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And in my case, that was before they, I don't know who they're using now, but they were having the endocrinologist do the procedure and those people, they're not, you know, really trained to be inserting things in your skin.

425
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So they had a one incidents where they were fishing around and couldn't get it out.

426
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:50,000
So they just went ahead and put a new one on the other side and then I had this thing here and I had to wait until somebody more skilled could get in there and pull it out and so yeah, I've got scars, whatever.

427
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I mean, I'm old now.

428
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
But it was like, I don't know if that was worth it, you know, keeping critical, but not, you know, but do it.

429
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
And this is what I say at my events to like, I want us to have those kind of conversations. I want people to get up and ask the point in questions.

430
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I've had a few things that got heated and some like early on, there was a couple of the patient.

431
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I have a kids who started like throw the F bombs and stuff and I'm like, no, we're not here to put anyone under the firing squad.

432
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Like, it's okay to say, I don't understand why you guys did this or, you know, this really isn't in the interest of patients, but you need to be polite and be constructive about it because we're trying to make things better.

433
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
We're not just trying to like take pot shots at each other when we last spoke.

434
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:47,000
You mentioned that this year, you're just, you're feeling like the shifting going on in politics, which then creates a shift, which is creating a shift in in the medical industry or FDA, you know, all of that and then there for affecting us.

435
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Just from your point of view, what are you feeling from this whole shift right now? What is your experience, especially with these events?

436
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:05,000
In impacts, probably for me and many other people's financial, you know, the companies are being very understandably very tight on budgets.

437
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:13,000
That means that affects the sponsorship money that we rely on and it also affects, you know, people wanting to being willing to come into pay.

438
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:22,000
You know, I feel like in previous years, certainly pre-COVID employees had some budget to attend a certain number of conferences a year.

439
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:30,000
They were able to get their travel cover, they, you know, paying the entrance fee to a professional conference was kind of expected.

440
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And now, more and more, everybody's asking for a discount code and, like, is concerned about whether they can come.

441
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,000
And, like I said, the federal agencies are not sending people out to do talks anymore, at least not at the moment.

442
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I mean, everybody's running a little bit scared there.

443
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:59,000
So, you know, I think we're all feeling that there's so much uncertainty right now, which is why we chose to have we're going to have our opening session in June talking about the shifts in health policy and how that's impacting our community.

444
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,000
But obviously the diabetes world is only one small sliver of the people being affected by this.

445
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:23,000
But yeah, and I don't think the powers that be at the top are thinking about people like us that are truly affected by these changes and potentially even the slowing down of innovation that this will cause, you know, so I'm excited to hear that.

446
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:31,000
You know, it was talking about, oh, MedTech devices are going to go up in price and one of the main things they were talking about is insulin pumps and I'm like, are you kidding me? They're already so expensive.

447
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Like, that's really scary.

448
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Yeah, I mean, the way it will look is the price of the pump will go up that's charged to the insurance company and then insurance company will raise premiums for everyone.

449
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
So it does affect everyone.

450
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
It does affect everyone.

451
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
The insurance companies are already so tight with their coverage.

452
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
You know, I don't think that's going to be going in any kind of beneficial direction for patients.

453
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So it is. It's just such uncertain times and, you know, it's really, it's, it's, I feel like it's mostly financial, although the current administration is also seems to be sort of anti research and anti progress and they're like pulling the plug from so many of these important, you know, research projects.

454
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:24,000
That's another whole issue that's scary and that doesn't seem to be wholly financial. I think it's also just sort of anti intellectual kind of trying to punish the people who came before who they thought were

455
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
being too loose. I think with the, with the support and the money for science.

456
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And I mean, I told the folks that are on this panel, like, we don't, we, we're not going to prepare too much because we're going to, we have to wait until a few weeks before they went.

457
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Right. Yeah.

458
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
What is actually happening?

459
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Yeah.

460
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Right. The entire first segment of the day are like, we need to rewrite this, you know, hopefully no change has happened that week.

461
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
In your eyes, what work is left to do?

462
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,000
There, you know, there was even a time a couple of years ago, not too many years ago, and they were sort of saying, maybe this whole weird.

463
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I'm waiting things, peatoring out maybe we don't really need this anymore, like the industry's catching up.

464
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And I was like, no, there's always more to be done.

465
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,000
And because technology is enabling things to go, you know, be faster, better, more efficient.

466
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:16,000
That just breaks open new possibilities for, you know, what we can do with the data platform, what we can do with an app.

467
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I think there's just, there's always more out there that has, you know, yet to be discovered or put together, you know, and again, cell therapy innovation.

468
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:37,000
We didn't talk about it for a long time because it felt, the cell therapy area just felt like it's sort of pie in the sky way off in the future thing, you know, it's going to be another couple decades.

469
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Now it's feeling closer and that is like a functional cure. I mean, that would be is kind of like living without diabetes, which is, you know,

470
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,000
and people who are taking GLP ones now are telling me that they feel the same way, they haven't taken a bolus in months, it just blows my mind.

471
00:50:51,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Yeah, I think a lot more research there with using AID with GLP ones could be big, especially some of the DIY apps.

472
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I know a lot of people are using GLP ones and they're not bolusing on those apps.

473
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:15,000
You know, I mean, it's just, again, it's kind of mind blowing when I think like where we started was the idea that you could even like see your blood sugar in real time was like mind blowing.

474
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And now we're talking about stuff where you're going to be able to live almost like you don't have diabetes, like, you know, all that math and all that boldest frustration and the worry about insulin on board, like all of those things are getting close to being solved.

475
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So, you know, I think there's, we're on the verge of some really exciting, you know, true breakthroughs after all these years of hearing about the breakthroughs is like this one to breakthrough breakthrough in the sense that it, you know, as we say everything that you create in this space should relieve patients of the burden, not give them more stuff to do.

476
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Well, Amy, thank you so much for coming on the show.

477
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I will be at the data, the data event in June at ADA, I'll also be moderating the GLP one moment.

478
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:04,000
And then also why don't we throw, I know it's an invite only, but you were telling me that people can inquire.

479
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,000
So I can throw something in the show notes for so people can inquire in whatever manner.

480
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:19,000
If you're involved in diabetes innovation, you have a role in this and you would like to come, you know, ping info at diabetesmind.com to request an invitation.

481
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,000
And the idea is that they should say at least a few words like give us a link or some kind of description of what your role is.

482
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
It's not open to the public, it is a leadership event.

483
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,000
But again, we're happy to, you know, welcome people who are involved in this space in some way.

484
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Yeah, yeah, great awesome. Well, that will be in the show notes and I will see you there, I guess.

485
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Yes, sounds great.

486
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Thanks for listening, new episodes air every Monday on YouTube and on all major podcast platforms.

487
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,000
If you want to read that letter to Steve Jobs, I thrown it in the show notes, I'm Justin and I'll take you later.
