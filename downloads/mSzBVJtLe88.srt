00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,280
Welcome to Justin Tech, I'm Justin Easter, for those of you who know me, I am obsessed

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,120
with my Fitbit Charge HR, I've had it for months now, so the only logical thing to do

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,200
is to go run out and buy the Fitbit Blaze and do a comparison video, so let's bring out

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:28,480
the contenders. We've got the Fitbit Blaze that retails for $200 and the Charge HR that retails

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,600
for $150, but you can buy them at best and you know what that means, you get a 20% off coupon

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:43,040
and you save lots of money. The Fitbit Blaze sports a super sleek looking screen that's

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,240
definitely bigger and more noticeable than the Charge HR. The tracker itself is just the square

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,400
piece in the middle and you can pop it out, you can replace the bands with different colors and

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,200
materials, they have metal, leather and the classic band which you're seeing here. Unlike the

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,320
Blaze, the Charge HR is just one piece. Once you've chosen one of the five colors, you're

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,840
stuck with it forever. The Charge HR's functions are very simple and limited and that's why I like

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,960
it. You can quickly and easily navigate between all of the day stats by tapping on the band and there's

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,760
also a quick view feature where you can double tap and it brings you right to a specific stat. You

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,080
can easily track or work out by holding down its only button and then when you're finished you hold

15
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,920
down again and it ends. The Charge HR also supports caller ID. When someone calls you the band

16
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,120
gives you one little vibration on your wrist and shows you their name, the band also supports four different

17
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,440
ways to display the time and or date. Now for the Blaze, the Blaze looks more like a smart watch,

18
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:48,960
but it isn't. Instead of tapping through each stat, you must slide, tap and then scroll to see all the

19
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,000
stats. You can set different clock faces that allow you to scroll through a few stats, but not all

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,760
of the faces show every stat and some don't even show any. I don't get it. Like why not?

21
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,760
Tracking your workouts on the Blaze is awesome and it displays a great workout screen. On top of

22
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,280
caller ID, the Blaze also supports text message and calendar alerts. You can scroll up from the bottom

23
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,320
and see all of your notifications. I'm not a huge fan of the caller ID on this tracker because when

24
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,079
someone calls, instead of it just vibrating once, it just continues to vibrate until you click the

25
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:27,519
button on it and if you don't answer the phone call, then you get another vibration that says you missed

26
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:31,840
the call and it's like, I know I missed the call, I just told you to shut up and stop vibrating

27
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,240
and you vibrate it again. The vibration on this thing is annoying. Luckily you can turn off the

28
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,519
notifications by scrolling down from the top. This is also where you can control the music from your phone

29
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,760
and you can control the volume for the music with the two buttons on the right of the Blaze.

30
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,680
The Blaze also has a stopwatch and a timer and you could also set alarms on and off. You just can't

31
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,680
create alarms. You must do that using the app, bummer. One of the coolest features of the Blaze is

32
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,239
FitStar. It's basically your own personal trainer. It comes with three different workouts and

33
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,760
guides you through them with vibrations and gyps. I'm not happy with the Blaze screen. It just isn't

34
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,040
very responsive. I try and move things back and forth or press buttons and it takes a few tries sometimes.

35
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,880
Both watches are water resistant but not waterproof. After ranked FitB Blaze for two weeks

36
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,200
there were practically no scratches on the screen. My charge HR on the other hand is full of scratches.

37
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,640
But I don't really care. What I do care about is what happened to my first. Yes, my first charge HR

38
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,799
I already had another one. It started bubbling up and then peeling off. But I was really pleased with

39
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,880
their customer service. They set me new when I had it in five days. When it comes down to choosing a

40
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:51,840
winner I can really only choose what's best for my lifestyle. So I have to say for me the charge HR is the

41
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,720
winner. I love that I could just tap through all of the statistics and that's it. If I want to start

42
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,240
to work out I press a button. With the Blaze it's just a little too convoluted for me and it's screen

43
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:10,000
is responsive enough and I hate the vibrations. The Blaze has a lot more functions than the charge HR

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,680
but when it comes down to it I want to fit this tracker that's simple. The charge HR is simple. It just works

45
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,640
and it works quickly. The Blaze just doesn't do it for me. If I want something as big as the Blaze

46
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,720
and with even more functions then maybe I just go for the Apple Watch which is only $50 more. Ultimately

47
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,680
I have to say the true winner here is Fitbit. I have never known so much about my body. Their app is

48
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,320
amazing. It graphs out my resting heart rate, my sleeping patterns, my workouts, steps, calories and they've

49
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,920
got some really great products that go along with that. I definitely recommend getting some sort of

50
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,120
Fitbit because the app is just that good. So that is it for my comparison video. If you have any

51
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,640
questions about the two bands or the app, please let me know in the comments below. Also, I would

52
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:03,040
love to hear which Fitbit tracker or any tracker for that matter that you love and why. Please subscribe
