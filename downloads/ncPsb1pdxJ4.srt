The Dexcomg7 is officially the longest lasting continuous glucose monitor.

00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,040
Here's what you need to know.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:14,720
The FDA just cleared a 15 day wear version of the Dexcomg7, making it the longest lasting

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,720
CGM. Plus, it's got a 12 hour brace period, so make that 15 in a half days.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,000
And get this, Dexcom says the accuracy is better than the 10 day version thanks to an updated

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,240
algorithm, dropping its marred from 8.2% to 8%.

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,240
The lower the better. The updated CGM will roll out in the second half of 2025. It is my

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,920
understanding that the sensor and the adhesive are exactly the same. It's just updated software.

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,960
I'm excited that I won't have to pack as many for trips. There will be less waste. But,

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,800
I'm a little apprehensive about the cleanliness of the CGM because I've noticed that the adhesive

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,480
can get really dirty by the end of the 10 day life cycle and not look as cute.

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,280
What do you think about the updated DexcomgCGM? Are you excited? Are you worried?
