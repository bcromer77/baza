00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Oh, well hello there YouTube, come on to my new smart home.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I just moved, so it's my second smart home.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This video is all about remote to buttons and switches around my smart home

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that you can get to make your life way easier and way smarter.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
A lot of people out there are saying, why do you need Alexa?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The reason is because I don't want to move, but if I'm okay with moving

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
or if I ever remote with me, then I'll use that.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I will have all of the links to these products, the best deals I've found

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
in the bio down below.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So let's come right over here to my power station.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So what we have right here is you may not recognize it, but this is a light switch.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We do not touch these in fact, I should put some tape over those.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What we do use though is this right here, and this is the Phillips Hue

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
like dimmer switch.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This thing is so, so great.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This alone is $25, but you can also get it for $35 with a light bulb.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I can control up to 10 light bulbs, just with this.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm turning them on, off, dimming them.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Great device and super cheap for what it does.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And if you're in the Phillips Hue family, this is like a note-brainer.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I would probably have five of these if I had more two lights around my house or bigger house.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
One day YouTube, one day.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The device that I just got in I am in love with is the Logitech Hop.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Actually put bell crow on it.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So that way I can kind of pop it off, put it to it.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
For the starter pack, it's $57.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The starter pack includes the bridge for the device and to just get a button.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's $40 as a smart home, liver and builder and creator.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm always looking for a device that connects all of my smart devices and this is it.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I can either tap it once, tap it twice or do a long tap.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Give me three different abilities.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If I tap it once, it turns on all my lights.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If I do a long press, it turns on the parting mode.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What that does is it completely transforms my entire apartment.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It turns off my light lights light into color light bulbs.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Also, right over here, I have my neon smile face.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That turns on with a wemo smart oven.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It sets my living or lights and my kitchen lights to dim.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And it turns on music.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And so whenever I'm gonna have friends, I'll write just long press that.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I actually haven't had many friends over since I've gotten that device soon.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I will.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So when I have friends and then when I have those friends over, I'm going to put party mode on.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
One day YouTube, one day.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
All I have to do to turn this off.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So that's party mode and I freaking love it.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This next device is one of my favorite devices.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It is the Logitech Harmony Remote.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And what I love about it so much is that it controls my complete entertainments.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So as well as all of my lights, it has a few different buttons right here that control my Apple TV.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
My Nintendo Switch.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
My speakers.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So if I want to watch a movie on Apple TV, all I do is press this movie button right here.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And it turns on my receiver.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Turns on my Apple TV.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And it will turn on my TV.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And then I can watch a movie.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Then if I want to turn it off, I just click this off button and it turns everything off.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I can change the light set if I want.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So this light right here, it's connected to this.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So if I don't want that on, it can turn off.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If I do want it on, but I want it in a little bit.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And just give it down right there.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And then I can turn this light off because it's a little too bright to the movie.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I want to turn my kitchen light off too.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And then that one.

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And then that one.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And then that one.

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And then another light bulb.

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And then we go to the club.

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And then we go out.

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And another one.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The Logitech Harmony Remote is 140 dollars.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And it is so worth it.

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
If you have a system or set up that will fully utilize its potential.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's sleek, light, and really comfortable in your hands.

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Who doesn't like something that's comfortable in your hands?

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Next.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's way right there.

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So welcome to my bedroom.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The one and only just a tech bedroom.

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Come on.

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I have this brand new pop button that I showed you over there.

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But this is the gray version of my tablet once.

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It will turn my lights on.

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I want to get things done.

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Some spring cleaning, summer cleaning, winter cleaning.

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I could double tap it.

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And it goes into like, move lighting when I want to get things done.

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And then I can hold it down.

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And it's a nice little night like late night.

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Then it'll switch.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So like late night pillow talk or just like late night nap time.

95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Get out of here.

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So there's your T's in switches, remote and buttons around a smart home.

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Basically, I've done so far.

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
