1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Oh, hey guys, how's it going?

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,200
It's Justin and if you know anything about me,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,560
it is that I am obsessed with Fitbit.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,920
I've been sporting the charge three for a while now,

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,200
but I wanted it up great.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,520
So I got the Fitbit Versa.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,960
I have a ton to say about both of these,

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,720
so I had to come out with a comparison video.

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,400
And there is a twist to this video

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,400
and it's not just that I'm taking my shirt off.

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,880
Also, did you know that you could subscribe to my channel

12
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,240
at any moment during this video, pressing that button down there?

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,400
Yeah, you can do it.

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,480
And you should do it.

15
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,320
Anyway, here's my comparison video.

16
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,880
You can take a look at this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this.

17
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,880
Real quick, the charge three goes for 149 and the Versa goes for $199,

18
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,160
but for Father's Day, both bands are on sale.

19
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,520
And that charge three is looking real cheap.

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,080
They both have a special edition,

21
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,360
which adds an NFC chip for credit card payments,

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,600
as well as an extra band.

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,800
And the Versa also comes in a light version for $159,

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,120
which I'll go into later.

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,720
The design of the charge three stains true to its predecessor.

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,160
It's a simple sleek watch with the tactical bands

27
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,200
you can easily switch out to dress it up or make it sporty.

28
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,960
The charge three has a small touchscreen,

29
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,920
and that's the perfect size to show off all the stats you want to see.

30
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,040
This is the first charge to not have a physical button,

31
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,840
but instead an inductive button.

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,560
The Fitbit Versa looks more like a smart watch.

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,280
It's got a super responsive and vibrant touchscreen

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,360
and three buttons, allowing for more options and commands.

35
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,320
You can also remove and replace the Versa's bands for new ones.

36
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,400
I definitely recommend going over to Amazon

37
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,680
and checking out the bands there

38
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,600
because they're cheaper and there's some cool ones.

39
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,240
Unfortunately, both of these watches

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,120
come with proprietary chargers.

41
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,360
This has always been one of my complaints with Fitbit

42
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,080
because the odds of someone else having the charger you need

43
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,200
is extremely rare.

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,320
Why can't we charge these with USB-C?

45
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,600
Money.

46
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,320
Also, I've gotta say the Versa chargers a little bit overkill.

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,600
It's huge and it's kind of loppy.

48
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,200
And most importantly, both watches are swift proof.

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,200
Ah!

50
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Oh!

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Holy!

52
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,680
Both the charge 3 and Versa are water-resisted up to 50 meters

53
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,280
and they automatically track your swims.

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,040
The charge 3 is very straight forward and simple,

55
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,240
and that's why I love it.

56
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,520
The touchscreen works seamlessly and smoothly,

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,200
and I was very impressed.

58
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,400
You swipe down for notifications and swipe up for stats.

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,880
I love how quickly and easily I can read off all my days

60
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,000
information and get back to my day.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,200
There are multiple watch faces to choose from.

62
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,320
I chose this one because I love how I can tap

63
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,280
through every stat quickly and easily.

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,320
To log in exercise, you swipe to the left

65
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,400
and choose an exercise you want to start.

66
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,360
The Versa screen it feels just as smooth

67
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,200
and seamless as the charge 3.

68
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,800
There are a bunch of watch faces,

69
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,400
some of which you need to pay for.

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,360
Fitbit allows third parties to create and sell watch faces.

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,280
Swiping down displays notifications,

72
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,440
clicking the top right button start to work out,

73
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,960
and the bottom right one sets alarms

74
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,640
that you can program right on the watch.

75
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,000
On the charge 3, you'll need to pre-program the alarms on the app.

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,800
Holding down the left button allows you

77
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,040
to access music controls for your phone

78
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,720
and music stored on the device.

79
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,920
That's right, the Versa allows you to put music

80
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,360
right onto the device, but more on that later.

81
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,560
Just like the charge 3, when you swipe up,

82
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,280
you can view all your stats.

83
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,360
I've got to say, the loading time on this has me a little put off.

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,680
Because if it's larger screen,

85
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,840
the Versa can show off a bunch more information.

86
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,920
It dives deeper into heart rate stats,

87
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,840
or average steps that we in details of last night's sleep.

88
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,600
But honestly, I don't really need all that information on my wrist.

89
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,880
If I want to get that information,

90
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,600
I'll take a deep dive into the app.

91
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,240
One of my favorite things about the Versa

92
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,720
is using it for exercise.

93
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,560
When I finish it gives me this great receipt of the workout.

94
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,920
The charge 3 also gives you a little receipt of your workout,

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,360
which is not as pretty.

96
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,160
Both watches also display calls,

97
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,000
texts, and other alerts very well,

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,360
and both watches automatically log to exercise,

99
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,840
which is my favorite feature.

100
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,040
The charge 3 gets an average battery life of up to seven days,

101
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,840
and the Versa has an average battery life of up to four days.

102
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,400
The watches have other apps,

103
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,359
and this is where we can see a lot of differences between the two.

104
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:03,959
Let's start with the charge 3 because it's much more limited.

105
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,040
There's relax, which helps you, you guessed it, relax,

106
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,959
with breathing exercises, a weather app, the timer, and alarms.

107
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,440
Now, the Versa has a much larger screen,

108
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,560
and with this great power comes great fitness tracker responsibility.

109
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,120
The Versa's got a bunch of apps.

110
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,040
There's the coach app, which provides on-screen workouts.

111
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,960
I try to couple out and I like it.

112
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,400
You'll need to pay for a subscription to fit bit coach

113
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
in order to access more than the three on the watch.

114
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,840
There's also a weather app, Starbucks app,

115
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,880
where you can put your rewards card, a timer, and an alarm.

116
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,320
You also have access to an app store

117
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,560
with apps like the New York Times, or Philips you,

118
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,960
so you can control your lights.

119
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,240
So one of the main things that sets the Versa apart

120
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,160
from the charge 3 is that you can put music on the watch

121
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,240
and connect it to your Bluetooth headphones.

122
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,320
Now it's gone around.

123
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,719
Now this was definitely one of the downfalls for the Versa,

124
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:51,240
because putting music on the watch

125
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,400
was a very disappointing and frustrating experience.

126
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,960
There's a music app which allows you to store 300 of your own songs,

127
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,240
but I don't own music.

128
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,760
I have a Spotify subscription.

129
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,680
I know a lot of people also have Apple Music.

130
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,080
This watch does not support either,

131
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,320
but there is a Pandora app.

132
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,840
So I signed up for a free month to try it out.

133
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,400
This was also a disappointment.

134
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,600
You could only put three stations on your watch at a time.

135
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,160
Not a playlist, but a random assortment of songs

136
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,560
based off of a station.

137
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,520
On top of all of this, it took the watch an hour

138
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,040
to load up on all the songs.

139
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,120
It like took me back to the first time I got an iPod,

140
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,400
but in a bad way.

141
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,480
Once the music finally loaded onto my watch,

142
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,000
I connected them to my power beats pro 3,

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,680
wireless headphones, and it worked pretty seamlessly.

144
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,560
And the music controls were great.

145
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,360
So I've gotta say, it's performing really well

146
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,800
playing music right from the watch.

147
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,560
I really like it, but I can't just in fine.

148
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,360
Getting this just for the music capabilities, right?

149
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,240
If it had Apple Music or Spotify, then I'd be all in.

150
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,560
I personally wear a fitness tracker

151
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,200
because I just wanna get some quick stats

152
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,680
and then go on with my day.

153
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,360
The charge 3 is simple and sleek

154
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,320
and I'm able to view and log all of my exercises quickly and easily.

155
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,560
It lacks the ability to program alarms and hold music,

156
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,240
but these are things that I'm able to sacrifice

157
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,560
with my fitness tracker.

158
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,640
The verse has a beautiful screen showing off

159
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,720
a ton of information, but it's a little slow

160
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,160
when it comes to loading times.

161
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,200
And as a bunch of apps and stores music,

162
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,040
but the lack of Spotify and Apple Music

163
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,640
is definitely noticeable.

164
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,960
If you subscribe to Pandora and don't mind waiting

165
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,000
an hour to load new music on the watch,

166
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,040
then I definitely recommend the verse up.

167
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,160
But like I said earlier, there's a twist.

168
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,600
There is a verse of light

169
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,240
and it's only $10 more than the charge 3.

170
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,480
And with that one, you're sacrificing just a few things.

171
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,280
You can't store music on the watch.

172
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,280
It doesn't have floors climb, swim map tracking,

173
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,080
and it doesn't have on-screen workouts.

174
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,120
So I feel like if it's between the charge 3

175
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,120
and a verse of, I'd go with the light version.

176
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,120
If the music is a non-issue for you,

177
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,360
then go for the verse up.

178
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,840
I've said this before, and I'll say it again,

179
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,720
but the true winner here is the Fitbit app.

180
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,200
It is amazing.

181
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,440
And ultimately, it's what prevents me from wanting

182
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,640
to get an Apple watch.

183
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,160
The graphs, statistics, and charts on this app are awesome.

184
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,400
I can see all of my workouts, zoom into each,

185
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,280
and get detailed stats on them,

186
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,080
and then compare them to others.

187
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,240
And because the Fitbits have such great battery life,

188
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,760
I can track and monitor my sleep patterns as well,

189
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,760
which is a lovely ability.

190
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,440
On top of it all, because I have the Fitbit Arias scale,

191
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,159
I'm able to map the progress on my weight

192
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:23,760
and body fat percentage.

193
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,400
Fitbit has some awesome software,

194
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,440
and honestly, the dream would be for the decree

195
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,599
now for the Apple watch.

196
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:31,039
Fitbit, listen to me, I will pay you $5 a month

197
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,440
for an Fitbit app on an Apple watch.

198
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,280
Please.

199
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,320
So I wanna hear your thoughts on Fitbit.

200
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,680
Which Fitbit do you have?

201
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,000
Which Fitbit do you love?

202
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,280
Also, which other smart watches do you like?

203
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,960
I wanna know because I wanna try them,

204
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,040
and then I wanna compare them.

205
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,120

206
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,280
