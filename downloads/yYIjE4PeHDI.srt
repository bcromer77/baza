Dexcom's 15-day continuous glucose monitor just got cleared by the FDA, but there are

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,320
high odds that that CGM won't even last you 15 days. You have to hear this. So many people

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,320
have been reporting on Dexcom's new CGM, including myself, but there is fine print at the bottom

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,640
of their PR release that shocked me. It says that a study was conducted to assess the sensor life

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:34,160
where 73.9% of sensors lasted the full 15 days, and 26% didn't reach 15 days. I reached out

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,320
to Dexcom for comments on this, and I also asked how many applicators and sensors people will get

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,440
each month. Right now we get three because they last 10 days, that's 30 days. They said that we will

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,440
be getting two a month. However, Dexcom did not respond to my question regarding sensor life.

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:59,680
What if 25% of our sensors aren't lasting enough time? We will obviously need to get replacements.

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,320
Right now, Dexcom has a limit for three replacements a year. Well, this means according to their

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,960
study that we will need six replacements a year. What do you think of this? Let me know in the comments

12
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,160
what is your current experience with Dexcom G7? My experience with the 10-day G7 is that they last

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,240
the full 10 days. Very rarely will they not. So, I'm a little worried about this 15 day in the fact

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,720
that 26% won't last that long? Yeah, interesting.
