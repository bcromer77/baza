00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Hey guys, it's Justin, welcome back to the channel,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,560
and today I have my top five iPhone tips

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,140
that you need to know.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:09,980
Here they are.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,680
My first iPhone tip is one that literally blew my mind

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,880
and that is being able to use the space bar

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,880
to navigate around your text.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,000
So this is how you do it.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,960
All I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hold down on the space bar

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,000
and see what happens.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I can actually move it all around this text.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,120
And it literally makes editing so much easier.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,120
You're gonna actually enjoy emailing on your phone now.

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,640
Next one, finding apps.

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,760
I rarely ever go and look for an app.

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,519
I just swipe down, type in like the first two letters

17
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:48,120
of an app and about a big bottom boom,

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,960
you got the app.

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,800
Love it.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,040
Okay, next, you can actually record your iPhone screen

21
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,760
and create videos.

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,000
You first have to set it up.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,960
First, let me just show you.

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
It's gonna be in this area right here.

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,000
See all these different abilities I have

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,200
and actually I'm doing it right now to show you this.

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,000
So that's the recording button.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,800
In order to customize this control center,

29
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,480
you need to go to your settings

30
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,080
and then go to control center and then customize controls.

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,680
In here, you can add a plethora of the apps.

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,160
There's the alarm app, there's voice memos,

33
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,600
which I use all the time, low power mode, easy access to that.

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,040
And the one I'm telling you right now is screen recording.

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,000
So I added that in.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,880
And then all you do to access it is swipe down

37
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,880
and you're gonna tap that record button

38
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,240
and then it will give you like a three, two, one.

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,760
And the way you know it's recording

40
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,440
is that the time in the top let corner will be red.

41
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,480
I use this all the time to show my parents

42
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,080
how to do things on the iPhone.

43
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,040
If there's like a private account on Instagram,

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,000
then I'll just record it and I'll send it to them.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,840
There you go.

46
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,120
This next feature was one that we've wanted for a very long time

47
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,280
and that's being able to quickly switch

48
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,040
between your Wi-Fi and your Bluetooth

49
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,880
and a few other things.

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,080
You swipe down your control center from the top right corner

51
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,640
and you can hold down this box up here.

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,760
And right there you can actually change your Wi-Fi

53
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,880
just by holding down on it.

54
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,199
And then there you go.

55
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,720
And also on Bluetooth, you can do the same thing.

56
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,080
And then you can also turn on your personal hotspot

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,800
and change your air drop.

58
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,040
This was just added in iOS 13.

59
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,160
So if you aren't upgraded, you should

60
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,000
so that you have that.

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,760
In this last one, one of my favorites

62
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,840
because I love math.

63
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,320
And that's being able to use Siri to do some calculations.

64
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,320
Hey Siri, what is 6 plus 7 plus 128 times 100?

65
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,560
That would be 12,813.

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,399
Cool.

67
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:40,920
Yeah, so when you're doing finances

68
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,000
and you're doing budget expenses,

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,079
you could just quickly read out your Excel spreadsheet numbers.

70
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,640
Well, I guess you could also just do the equation in Excel.

71
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,359
So if you're not in Excel

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,440
and you're in your notes, you could read those out

73
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,600
and Siri will do that calculation for you.

74
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,400
Those are the iPhone tips that I have for you today.

75
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,840
But stay tuned because I'm going to be doing a top five

76
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,480
feature request video for Apple

77
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,800
because there are some features that they need to include

78
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,480
and still have it.

79
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,640
And also they need to fix by my friends.

80
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,200
I really just need them to fix it

81
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,320
because I miss how it used to work.

82
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,400
Anyway, if you guys have any iPhone tips,

83
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,800
wanting to leave those in the comments below

84
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
because I want to know what they are.

85
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,760
Also, I have a lot of content coming out.

86
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,160
I'm going to see you guys in a couple weeks

87
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,600
and I'll be pouring out videos.

88
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,359
So why don't you guys subscribe to this channel

89
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:26,920
and give it a like if you enjoyed it.

90
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,640
That's all I've got for you guys today.

91
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,959
I'm Justin and I'll take you later.
