00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Tell me about this diabetes educational app level one.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,960
The game is super simple. You come in and there's a nurse and she just talks you through everything.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,080
You come in and you're high. You got a dose insulin to bring it down.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,880
There's an insulin needle to bottom screen. You tap it, drag over. I think to like two units or something.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,760
Goes in. You watch the insulin go in. You watch it activate the cells. It's like great.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,320
Now you just learn how to dose insulin. Now you have to deal with a few highs and how to correct.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,480
Then food starts appearing. Then you have to start learning about pre-bolicing.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,160
Initially the foods just tell you, oh, for this food you're going to need right now a

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,880
unit of insulin or two units of insulin, just a little tag above the food. But eventually that goes

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:47,200
away. And it just shows you the carb count. So there's 60 levels. There's food that's just moving in

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,480
on a conveyor belt, dropping into your digestive system, getting broken down to these gorgeous

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,560
glucose particles. You inject insulin. It comes in off the side. Activates the cells and just sucks

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,560
in the glucose. And you just play the game for two hours and you've mastered every major topic that you need for the

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:14,560
first six months of MDI.
