00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Hey guys, welcome back to my channel. I am so excited for this episode because I am at

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,760
sandbox VR. They have a bunch of different VR experiences from throwing players into a pirate

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,600
treasure hunt to shooting aliens on a futuristic space station. And now you can even beam into the

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,440
Star Trek universe. This is one of the most unique VR locations I've ever been to. It's no wonder

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,080
Katy Perry, Justin Timberlake and Will Smith have invested millions into this place. You can play with

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:36,880
up to six people in these experiences. Let's put our living stereo stylus in this room.

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,880
When you first walk into sandbox VR, you're completely transported to a futuristic station.

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,200
There are multiple green screen stages set up for parties to enter the virtual world.

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,280
These rooms and conjunction with the gear you put on will track your every move to fully encapsulate

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,360
you into the virtual world. Today, my friends and I are playing two of their five experiences.

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,080
We put on hand and foot trackers so the cameras in the room could track us. Before we even

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,240
enter the virtual world, there was a unique pregame experience. We split into two teams and chose team names.

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,000
Next, we took player pictures. The first game we played was unbound fighting lead. It's a player

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,200
first player game where you fight the opposing team with your choice of three weapons. Each weapon

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,560
has its own ability and play style. Whether it's throwing out landmines or sending fire towards your opponent.

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,840
Before we started the actual game, there was a tutorial where we chose our avatars and learned the game

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,720
mechanics. Then we were transported into an arena from an underground elevator. It literally felt like we were in the

18
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:49,360
hunger games. Each round a player from each team entered the stage to fight. The rounds were a workout.

19
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,560
I wouldn't recommend playing this game with under four people because you need the time to rest between rounds.

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,240
The game had wind effects which made us feel like we were there and the sandbox employee was a commentator

21
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:09,440
giving us tips and play by play announcements. I could totally see this in a VR esports setting

22
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,120
and that is definitely the plan with sandbox. So I'm super excited for the future of VR esports.

23
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,359
After playing that game, all right, next up we got dead wood mansion. It's a bit different of an experience and I'm

24
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:27,440
so ready for it. In this game, we were all in the same team sent to a mansion to fight off

25
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,880
hordes of zombies. Each way brought new enemies where we needed to adapt and figure out their weaknesses.

26
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,480
We even got to choose the weapons we wanted. A submachine gun, dual pistols or sniper rifles.

27
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,760
The game was full of scary moments and we screamed a lot. It was challenging too and we could

28
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,880
even die and our teammates would have to revive us. Compared to you with L, the graphics seemed less

29
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,399
vivid, especially when there were a lot of zombies coming at us in once. But this also makes sense since

30
00:02:54,399 --> 00:03:00,880
this is the first experience sandbox ever made. Sandbox VR offers a unique VR experience and is

31
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:06,560
completely different than another one of my favorites the void. The void has you walking around a maze

32
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:14,480
and is more cinematic and sometimes scary. Sandbox is all about teamwork and physical activity.

33
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,560
I will say there were some technical snafos that need to be polished. It took about 20 minutes for them

34
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,640
to get dead wood mansion up and running and some of us had issues with our guns. Mine worked just fine.

35
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,000
You a fell took about 10 minutes of troubleshooting to begin because a couple of our avatars were stuck

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,680
into split position on the ground. But it was funny. Technical difficulties aside, Sandbox VR

37
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,600
is building a desirable experience here and I highly recommend everyone to check it out. They offer

38
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,360
the most player customization I've seen at any VR location and some of the best replayability.

39
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,760
After our games we went into the lobby and watched awesome the edited replay videos. This little touch

40
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,520
added to the overall experience letting us continue the fun outside of the game. I asked Cameron the

41
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,600
general manager what Sandbox has in store for the future. So what they can really expect is

42
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,760
this kind of getting a bit more involved in like tournament self and now we have to be a fell. We're really

43
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,480
trying to really expand not only in terms of our stores but also in terms of our content. Always looking for

44
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,640
something new so we finally did PvP and that's one of the first ones to do it. So we want to see what

45
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,200
us we can do with that maybe doing tournaments or kind of really opening the door and seeing hey can we get

46
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,280
something going on that's like a membership or eSports or something along those lines. My guess is VR eSports

47
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,360
is going to grow a lot over the next few years and I can't wait to be there for it. That is Sandbox VR.

48
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,800
It was so awesome. You definitely have to check it out. It is located in a bunch of different cities

49
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,480
and a bunch or more are coming this year and early next year. So definitely check it out. If you guys want to see

52
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,840

53
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,440
you today. Stay tuned for another video coming next week. I'm Justin and I'll take you later.

54
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,920
I can feel you guys watching me right now. No.
