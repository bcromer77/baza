00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There is a major shift going on in the diabetes technology world in the US, and it's changing how we access our tech.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
For years, getting an insulin pump in the US meant going through durable medical equipment, or DME,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
a convoluted, expensive process that often locked people into four-year contracts and required paying a lump sum upfront.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But that model is starting to change.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
More and more insulin pumps are moving to pharmacy benefits, just like we've seen with CGMs.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That means more flexibility for users, easier access, and a shift of risk going from the insurance company to the manufacturer.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Today we're getting into what this looks like and how it will affect you.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Welcome to Diabetic.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm Justin, I have Type 1 Diabetes.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
On here, I talk all things diabetes tech, news, and innovation.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I've got episodes of this podcast every Monday on YouTube and podcast platforms, and videos coming out on Friday,

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and on social media at Diabet, underscore tech.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
OmniPod is currently only available through the pharmacy.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The upcoming twist pump will be two and beta bionics is working to roll out its eyelet pump in the same way.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Today I'm joined by Jeff Delverne.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The mind behind the healthcare economy, Substack, where he breaks down the complexities of the US healthcare system.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He's also the director of pay-or-relations at beta bionics, where he is leading the charge to transition the eyelet pump to pharmacy benefits.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Jeff and I get into what the transition will look like from the benefits of being able to switch pumps without a year-long contract.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
To how this new model might push companies to innovate faster in order to retain these patients who are essentially month to month.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I also push Jeff on potential challenges, like the risk of insurance companies introducing tiered pump coverage, similar to drug formularies.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If you haven't heard it, Jeff came on the podcast a few months back to talk about how PBMs are making record profits.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:15,000
They are making 60% year over year, and we get into all of the complexities there and how these companies are owned by insurance companies.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It is a great episode. Go listen to that.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Jeff, welcome back to the show. It's good to have you here.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah, thanks for having me back on. It's good to be on after kind of more of a little bit more of a downer show with the health insurance and community economics after the death of the UHC CEO.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah. PBMs are making 60% profits year over year.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Love that as patients don't really get much more.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So yeah, be sure to listen to that episode. But today we are talking all things pharmacy benefits when it comes to insulin pumps.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:10,000
There's a big shift going on in the industry. And I'm excited to kind of hear about your work and what you're doing at beta bionics because you're playing an integral role there.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Shifting from DMA to pharmacy benefits.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So first, kind of tell me a little bit about the work that you're doing at beta bionics.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah. We're transitioning into the pharmacy channel from the DMA or the medical benefit.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Similar to kind of how you saw with CGMs over the last five or six years with with Dexcom moving in the pharmacy and then Abbott really starting in pharmacy.

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And it's kind of a change to the paradigm, the revenue model and just how you know type one patients that use these pieces of technology.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We'll engage with their healthcare. And really it's a paradigm shift from DMA, which is seen as more of like a chronic ongoing patient engaged more touch points needed versus, you know, the pharmacy, which is really more of a dispensing arena or channel.

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And as these things automate and get smarter and smarter. I guess is a good way to put it.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You're going to see them move more and more towards the pharmacy channel.

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Tell me a little bit more about what you're specifically doing at beta bionics as it relates to getting pumps from DMA to the benefits to the pharmacy.

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's a bit of a payment model shift like historically DME sits in the medical benefit and so the cost for the patient out of pocket is is very high and I think most people that have gotten a pump through DME kind of see that they feel that.

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And the main reason is that initial cost of the hardware upfront and then the patient's portion of that is usually 10, 20% of the overall cost of the device.

43
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And so it can create a barrier for patients and one of the things when I came to beta bionics was we wanted to put this in the hands of as many folks as possible so that they have access to it.

44
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The biggest barriers we saw were you know ease of use and out of pocket expenses and so we feel like the island is the you know easiest to use of you enter your weight and then kind of follow your meals and then you know this kind of helps us then move to how do we get the out of pocket down.

45
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:54,000
In the pharmacy we're going at risk we're rebating the hardware and then we're earning it through taking great care of the beneficiary through monthly pharmacy installments to get ourselves whole so we look at it more of like a value based type of arrangement where we say to the health plan.

46
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We believe in the island to the effect that we're willing to go at risk for that money upfront we're going to take great care of your your beneficiaries your members your patients to earn.

47
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Our keep and so it is a paradigm shift I think our goal is really.

48
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:21,000
To get that out of pocket for the patients as low as possible so that everyone can get on and pump therapy in the island.

49
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, I mean I just experienced the whole DME thing myself I was testing out movies so I got this pump to try it out they have a return policy.

50
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:44,000
90 day return policy so I tried this out I had to pay a little over nine hundred dollars to to get it right that's my my and not only just that money but I'm now I would then be.

51
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:57,000
stuck with this or I'd be under warranty for four years in the DME space right I couldn't just try another pump like beta bionics or or others over DME for four years.

52
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I could see that being a lot of money for people especially since insurance already is so much for people you're paying these premiums you're paying co-pays you're paying prescriptions then you're telling me that none of that includes a pump.

53
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So so this shift to pharmacy benefits which is something that I've been enjoying for three years with my omnipot just paying co-pays monthly which sure if you added all up maybe over four years it's about the same amount of money but that.

54
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:37,000
initial cost of a thousand dollars could be too much for many people so I think that when it comes to accessibility it seems like.

55
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
pumps could get into the hands of more people with this model.

56
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Why does the work you're doing feel important to you.

57
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Great question I am of rare breed so I started in the field it calling on positions and families so I had to sit in front of a lot of those families and have those difficult conversations where they would say.

58
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't know that I can afford twelve hundred dollars or nine hundred dollars and I know my daughter needs this.

59
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So how do we make that happen and a lot of times we didn't right or maybe we would say maybe we'll try later in the year and then that patient would.

60
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But ultimately never getting on pump there because they were motivated at the time but maybe not later in the year whatever it may be right so.

61
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Sitting in front of positions families and hearing their story about how I mean that it nine hundred dollars is a significant investment for something.

62
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That you don't know if you're going to love you know how it's going to work and so I think you know being on that end of it really showed me like this is important I always drove me crazy having to have those conversations and so when I'd heard.

63
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What what they were doing at beta by odds I had worked a lot with these folks in the past having been at tandem and then knowing a lot of these colleagues through Dexcom and through.

64
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,000
In pen I kind of knew that this was a rare opportunity to do something good with my career and so.

65
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I really jumped on the opportunity to to make this move so that we can get the out of pockets a little more affordable for people to try pump therapy.

66
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This episode is sponsored by OmniPod as someone with T1D and with an incredibly active lifestyle it's important for me not to get tied up especially with tubes on my insulin pump.

67
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I love to go swimming, lift weights and play kickball with friends and with OmniPod 5 I never have to worry about tubes getting in the way.

68
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Plus not having to disconnect helps me to stay in range during all of my favorite physical activities that include 60 time too.

69
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:04,000
See if you're eligible for a 30 day trial by visiting OmniPod.com slash dive tech on there you'll see full safety and risk information and trial terms that's OmniPod.com slash dive tech.

70
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Explain to us a little better what the landscape has been so far whether that's you know the trend maybe the transition that CGMs already kind of went through.

71
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What what did that kind of look like.

72
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah, I think that was a slow process and I think you're seeing it play out here as well because driving change in the healthcare industry can be.

73
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You know, it just it takes time because it is a paradigm shift so.

74
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You know from the changes right I'd see the biggest like change that that tax time probably saw as they got some pdn contracts and then they had to go to downstream health plans to talk through.

75
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Why it made sense to move it from medical benefit to pharmacy benefit and those are two totally different benefit designs and I told you a little bit.

76
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You know when you think about medical benefits usually not cash on delivery they're not designed for you to pay upon getting the services so if you think about.

77
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You know most of those medical benefit claims it's a hospital claim or physician claim where you go see your doctor and then.

78
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You pay the bill later right so you're not having to pay the bill before they'll see you versus the pharmacy benefit was really designed for low copays because it's cash on delivery year not getting the medicine unless you.

79
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You know pay the bill and so the benefit design you know if you look at the national like healthcare expenditures that Medicare releases every year what is the average on a pocket for DME it it's going to be 47 to 40% of the patient is paying that portion of it right versus.

80
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Pharmacy is going to be 10 to 13% out of pocket right and the reason is is because it's designed for you to have to pay the cash around as soon as you get the services so.

81
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The design of the benefit is lower copays because you are having to pay it like for instance you don't walk in and say hey I need.

82
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You know my my sleep needs a you know attention I need to do surgery and they say well we're not going to work on you until you.

83
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Pay us cash today and then in the pharmacy that is kind of what happens right they say just and.

84
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's 400 dollar copay and if you say well I can't pay it all the day they say you can't pick up the meds so it's a little bit of a different benefit design.

85
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
One's designed for medical you know medical claims.

86
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:58,000
One's for pharmacy prescription drugs and lower copays and so the move for CGMs.

87
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And pumps really makes a lot of sense to be able to get that out of pocket down.

88
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
How does it work on like an insurance company side.

89
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Specifically like with yeah with DME how we're insurance companies.

90
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Paying for that differently than with for pharmacy benefits.

91
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah so in the DME space typically what happens is there's what's called hectic codes and those are medical billing codes and.

92
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The additional insulin pumps would fall under any code EO seven eight four and then the monthly supplies would be.

93
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You know a four two three zero a four two three one a four three.

94
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Three two yeah a four two three two which is those are like the infusion sets and cartridges basically and you would bill those monthly.

95
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:01,000
To the insurance company or the pump once every four years so the paradigm shift was you would get you know say four or five thousand dollars upfront for the pump.

96
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And then we'll say a hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars a month thereafter for supplies.

97
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
This is basically saying to the insurance company.

98
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You're holding all the risk in that original four to five thousand dollar payment.

99
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Actually for go that.

100
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Get it to your patient and then we'll earn it back through monthly installments for the supplies through taking great care of it.

101
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So if we lose if the patient hates insulin you know from the therapy and one to three but if we went we went if they are long term adopters of the technology.

102
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And you you explained to me last time we spoke that that reason exactly right there could affect.

103
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Innovation in the space right tell me about why that is.

104
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah I think you're going to see competition really in that space that the PBM space is.

105
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You know there's three that control 80% of the market there's four that control 90% of the market so there's a lot of compression for us to bid against each other for for better pricing.

106
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Because there's not a warranty in place yet.

107
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You could get people switching from one brand to the next and so it's going to force.

108
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Everyone to to constantly drive more and more innovation to the customer in order to earn their business and earn that reimbursement.

109
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So kind of back to my take great care of the beneficiary in order to continue to get their business.

110
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Now there are some companies that still remain on DME and haven't to my knowledge made an effort to move toward pharmacy benefits.

111
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Why what is the incentive for companies to remain on DME.

112
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You know I think there's it in pharmacy as I said because.

113
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You know there's such hierarchy control consolidation that there is going to be price compression and so I think initially.

114
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Price is will be good for the manufacturers but pinning us against one another and making us negotiate for or military positioning I think is.

115
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Is scary to some right so think about.

116
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
DME channel right those those codes that e code and those a code.

117
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,000
They've relatively been the same for 25 years so there's not a lot of price compression.

118
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The same token there's not a lot of price.

119
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You know inflation so it's kind of a double edged sword but I think you're seeing some of the manufacturers.

120
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Maybe taking away to see approach maybe at some point they will come in to date.

121
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I think you're seeing more and more embrace kind of the pharmacy model of page you go.

122
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah, you know that news just came out recently of metronics new CGM simpler a sink getting cleared and coming out to 70G users in the US this fall.

123
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But in the fine print it says that.

124
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Only new users can get access to it they need to get a new pump which means a new four year warranty in order to get the new CGM that is a huge leap over the last one.

125
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:43,000
All other users you know if you're one year in you still have three years left with the pump you're on before you can start this huge advancement.

126
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I mean what are your thoughts on that really.

127
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Like all the companies I've worked for are.

128
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You know with tandem was you know started for you know a reason and a lot of the folks there.

129
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You know think highly of patient choice and being able to keep patients you know happy and what they want to do because.

130
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The old saying is you know the device that they'll do the best on is the one the patient chooses and I think.

131
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:22,000
At beta baronics we believe that as well so for me I'm never like a huge fan of like a lock in on one piece of technology or being.

132
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You know married to one piece and I think that was the innovation behind.

133
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You know if you're thinking about it you know the T slim was software of dateable right and then you're seeing us is the first.

134
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You know you're going to want to make an insolent pump to ever make you know make it in pharmacy to give optionality and local pay so.

135
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,000
For me that that's not like something that I love but at the end of the day you know each company is going to have kind of their.

136
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Sacred cows and I would say ours is more drive innovation.

137
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Try to wrap ourselves around the customer and try to continue to innovate towards what they're looking for.

138
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah I mean the T slim just came out with a new like an algorithm update like a huge update just you know over the air and the the fact that with a metronic pump that users would have to.

139
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You know sign a new for your contract or have to wait you know anywhere from.

140
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
One to three years in order to do that just sounds.

141
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Really tough as innovation continues.

142
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
With this model of foreign pharmacy benefits.

143
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Let's say metronic was pharmacy benefits and this is hypothetical but do you think that.

144
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Things like this wouldn't happen as often that.

145
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Patients with this model could.

146
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Get upgrade sooner because they're essentially month to month.

147
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah absolutely I think you're going to like.

148
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:03,000
When you zoom out right like the the pharmacy benefit managers in America have a lot of leverage and a lot of power right given.

149
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The companies that they're involved with whether it be signal whether it be CDS you know whether it be not you know united health group.

150
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:22,000
They're all market caps of you know several hundred billion dollars so they they have a lot of leverage right and so they're going to force the manufacturers.

151
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
To do what they want right like I think it would take a huge.

152
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Innovation.

153
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:37,000
In the space that to be able to get enough leverage on a pdm to say here's the rules will come in the pdm I just.

154
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Typically that's that's not something I've seen right even in GLP one space that's really hot and.

155
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I don't even see them having that kind of leverage to say.

156
00:20:49,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Mr. pdm you know if you do this you're going to have to do that they they still kind of need to get access to the pdm's beneficiary so.

157
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I don't know that a pump manufacturer given like house side you know what you know because we're pretty small compared to GLP one spend.

158
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I don't know that they'll bend or break for one of us to be honest with you.

159
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:26,000
How does this shift if at all relate to the systems outside of the US if someone in Europe is you know deciding between say like a pump on.

160
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
How how's that work between like omnipod or say.

161
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Metronic is do they have similar options as we do just in like a way that their.

162
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Government pays for it. Yeah, they usually kind of more mirror like our traditional like DME model so they don't have access to this type of you know system where.

163
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You know we need to have like a pharmacy benefit or move in the pharmacy at least at this time that I'm aware of most of them.

164
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Do not and I don't know.

165
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Given where they're at in their healthcare life cycle if that's anything in the near future but through domestic that's I think where things are had I'd you're going to see more more of these things.

166
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Moving to that space and I believe omnipod at least in the pump space was kind of the first to really move in this direction.

167
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
How did that go or how has that gone since they they started.

168
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yeah, I think initially everybody was like, oh, you know, this is not going to work well, but it has worked really well for them.

169
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Essentially they know Jim just moved to more of a subscription model where they're getting X amount per five pod packs and it's worked out really well for them frankly there you know gross margins are very strong they've had some of the best quarters of their.

170
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:02,000
In their company's history over the last you know eight ten quarters so for them it's worked amazing and frankly in the in the zoom out you know someone who's been in the space for a decade.

171
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I think it's now going to be really really good for patients as we move from kind of this high copay into this lower lower out of pocket to get access I think that's really the biggest thing is.

172
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You know, twenty five dollars out of pocket for someone to try pump therapy I think that's fantastic.

173
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yeah, I mean you've got omnipod doing this twist is coming out soon that will be through pharmacy benefits beta bionics is actively.

174
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Transitioning or or opening those doors up and has had success.

175
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Is there a lot of pressure on these other companies that haven't quite made that switch to do this switch I mean tandem has their 90 day return policy which is something I mean try it for 90 days essentially for free which is actually pretty good.

176
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:03,000
But then you're stuck to that four years right like I am returning my movie so I did essentially get to use this for free for three months which.

177
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah me.

178
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:14,000
But outside of that like are these companies feeling like okay well maybe instead of that 90 day return policy we actually do pharmacy benefits.

179
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yeah, I think so you know I'm not I don't know how it's all going to play out but I would say at one you know at some point you know traditional utilization management like in a health insurance company they want to.

180
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You know bring all the class in one channel and try to drive down price and so I would imagine at some point.

181
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You see everybody kind of pushed into the pharmacy channel down the road you know where it sits today right like.

182
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You know I'm a pot is say it's 100% through pharmacy and they've got 75% coverage right of the covered lives in the US.

183
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You know if you look you know with us we've been the most successful to pump I think we started you know the year mid single digits and we're guiding to you know mid twice you know above 20% here for.

184
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:25,000
For this year we're having quite a bit of success and then twist is early right there maybe a week or two here on the market you know how much success so they're going to have you know driving it into into the pharmacy I think.

185
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It will be seen but you know tandem movie is now on some formularies I know they're trying to move into the pharmacy as well so it's not on okay it is on everybody's radar.

186
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:51,000
That is a move and I think to my earlier point I think we're going to be violent told in some respects so insurance companies are essentially paying less.

187
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Immediately and just over time right that's like the scheme on what they're seeing on their end.

188
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
So in the current model they they're they're bearing most of the risk right because they're paying for that.

189
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:15,000
See it's a five thousand dollar claim and the patient has to come up with a thousand they pay there are the employer right pay the four thousand dollars well if the patient doesn't love it.

190
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And you know uses it for two or three months and then doesn't return it right like they've now buried that risk.

191
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Bruce is in the new model we're saying we will go at risk and and rebate the hardware and then earn it through monthly.

192
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Supply orders through the pharmacy okay so that makes sense so you're saying someone gets a tube pump they try it they don't love it so then they put that on pause they put it in their closet and then they start getting a pump over.

193
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Pharmacy benefits and they're using that so essentially the insurance company has not only paid for that to pump but now they continue to pay for these.

194
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Pumps that are coming through pharmacy which is totally a thing right now that's what I've done.

195
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Now instead it would be a company like beta bionics that says no will lay out the money that give this device to that person and then if they decided to put it in their closet whatever.

196
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:30,000
We'll not whatever but you're essentially out that money would there and would there or why wouldn't there be a system in place where beta bionics says alright if you didn't like it.

197
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You know give us just give you can just give us back the pump no charges here but like I mean.

198
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I mean couldn't you use it like why wouldn't you want it back oh I guess that there's incentive if they still have it to go back on it.

199
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yeah I think in pharmacy there's no returns right so it's again that CME.

200
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Yeah so yeah so it's kind of a catch 22 as it sits today that we wouldn't get it right back but maybe there's a situation where it's really the core thing of it is like does the manufacturer believe in the product.

201
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Do they think you're going to fall in love with it and if you do you'll go at risk and if you don't maybe you know maybe it's not a product issue maybe it's a cost of goods issue so for us we kind of look at it and say.

202
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I mean a lot of the folks end up loving it so we're going to earn our money back and today that's what has borne out so for us we we feel like it's good value we think don't be more and more that that emulate.

203
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah and correct me from wrong like the pump itself isn't necessarily worth like $8000 the money that you're paying is going toward the R&D right or like all of the money that's gone into making this device but like you can't tell me that these mechanics are worth you know $9000.

204
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I don't know what everyone's tags are right like and I don't know that I would want to like disclose it but at the end of the day you want to be really thoughtful.

205
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Every manufacturer does around how we build these things make sure they we can get the best technology into them at a cost of the issue of way so that we can get more and more people.

206
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You know it with great time and range that's really like kind of the credo of being here at that bit of a annex so.

207
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Today's episode is sponsored by T1D Exchange. You can directly make an impact on diabetes health care treatments and technology by participating in the T1D Exchange registry.

208
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It starts with the simple survey about your life with T1D and it only takes about 15 minutes after that you'll have a personal portal with ongoing T1D study and survey opportunities.

209
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Plus some of these studies even offer compensation signing up with the link in the show notes help support my channel and it allows me to continue putting out free content you can sign up at t1dxchange dot org slash diabetic or click that link in today show notes.

210
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I do want to get into how patients will see this on their end because I do see the benefits here but I also see potential downfalls.

211
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,000
First of all the benefit is accessibility right we kind of covered that a bit but.

212
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:41,000
This will be a much more accessible system in the sense that someone doesn't have to lay out five plus thousand dollars whatever it is or nine hundred bucks in my case immediately but they could just you know pay twenty five bucks a month and then.

213
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Put a pause on it they want to go to MDI for a second go back to pumps whatever are there other.

214
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Are there areas that this is opening up accessibility wise other than kind of that.

215
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah, I mean I think with with obviously with with type two's that's always been what you hear about with.

216
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:17,000
When you listen to an army pot earnings call as they're really dead set on on attacking that market because of the size so I think if you're asking.

217
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:26,000
A primary care to work with the DNA for an order it can be challenging that's just not a primary care physicians not really equipped they don't.

218
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
The staff that the paperwork faxing.

219
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And when you think about how quickly claims are adjudicated through pharmacy, it's usually an EHR script and then it comes and it's pretty much within a few days you're going to get the product versus you know the DMA which is going to be.

220
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yeah, you know one two five six week or deal.

221
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Yeah, and then I'm sure if you think about it like you know many type ones feel that the pump is so necessary for their everyday life but I can imagine that there are a lot of people with type two that.

222
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Don't feel that way necessarily so their ability to say oh sure I'll pay a copay of twenty five fifty bucks to try something out.

223
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:22,000
They're much more willing to do that than oh yeah sure I'll throw out nine hundred dollars for something I'm not really sure I want to use and yes there's return policy but.

224
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
The idea of laying out that money immediately is not the most exciting thing for people.

225
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You know it and when you zoom out and look at like the diabetes like wallet right so.

226
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:48,000
In the US the average person costs about fifteen thousand dollars a year for care someone with type one is going to be in that twenty five thousand dollar range right and so.

227
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Then think about like your super user so people that are highly engaged use a CGM use a pump are all like all and on taking care of themselves.

228
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
It can be forty or fifty five thousand dollars a year right and.

229
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,000
How much spendable income do they have so if you think about forty thousand dollars a year spending taking care of yourself.

230
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:19,000
In your responsibility of that is seventy two hundred dollars you know you're out of pockets roughly eighteen percent of that.

231
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:28,000
That's that's pretty expensive that's an extra you know six hundred dollars a month on care and I'm sure you feel that right like it's.

232
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And so in CGM supplies and then that does include your appointments right so.

233
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:45,000
How much more money is there in your wallet to extract and I think we think a lot about that at beta bionics is.

234
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
How do we bring these technologies.

235
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
To market in a way that we can get them to the people without.

236
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Kind of adding to that burden so it's a very weird space when you think about nine hundred twelve hundred eighteen dollars out of pocket.

237
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:15,000
That that does not help the case to just to kind of make sure those folks have more spendable income with this new model.

238
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Does it affect people.

239
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
You know who don't have insurance.

240
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Does it affect their kind of out of pocket any differently does it make it any easier for someone who.

241
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Maybe they just kind of lost their health insurance and they they go three months without it but still want to get three months supplies.

242
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
How would this look.

243
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
For them or would it look any differently.

244
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Because they wouldn't have health insurance they're not going to have like pdm coverage but they still may be able and I don't know for for sure but they would have to check to see.

245
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Is there like a pdm card that they can get access to that would.

246
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You know allow them whether it be like a good or X card to get access to.

247
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Kind of the pdm rates I think the cash pays are still going to be.

248
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You know pretty high but it would probably be the best way to go because there are no generics of all these products got you and you mentioned earlier you said so you said tiered and when you said it I cringe because I experienced.

249
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I experienced tears in my own health insurance where I have a preferred insulin that my insurance company told me I needed to switch to it doesn't work for me.

250
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It actually causes burning and then the other one they offered doesn't work either right so I got a prior off for a different insulin and.

251
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:55,000
They approved it but when I got the bill for the new insulin instead of the normal.

252
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
$155 for three months it went to $255 for three months.

253
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I I guess I'm ignorant I didn't realize that that could even happen that something I am approved for by my doctor saying that your insolence don't work for me this one does that they can charge me so much more money for that insulin.

254
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Could we see that with insulin pumps if all the insulin pumps go you know pharmacy benefits are we going to see oh that's the one you want actually that's going to cost you three times more like that almost sounds worse.

255
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Yeah I think you you could see that down the road I know that all the manufacturers are really pushing against that to try to keep it.

256
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You know similar parity today it's looking more you know like tier two versus tier three which is not significant you know it might be a 20 dollar out of pocket a month.

257
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I think that the hope would be to try to keep that I think the fear is exactly what you said where you have kind of.

258
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:17,000
One company really goes after it for a preferred and then there's you got to try one pump to get to the next I think that would that's something we all.

259
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Certainly want to avoid just because most of the manufacturers that I meet with I talked to really want pump choice back to the original what's you know which patient what do they do passed on it's the one that they choose so I don't.

260
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:50,000
You know as it's today I would say you know hopefully that's not the case but in a historical utilization management within the pharmacy channel that is kind of typically I would say the downsides of this move.

261
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Yeah I mean choosing an insurance already feels like one of the most difficult tasks because there's this list of questions you need to ask oftentimes you don't even realize the questions you have to ask and I feel like so many of these companies run in a way that's oh well you can find that answer out once you have the insurance.

262
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:18,000
There's like no I want to know how much everything's going to cost so to me it sounds like there's there could be a new question.

263
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
In the future of oh and what pumps do you cover and what tiers are they which.

264
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Honestly hurts a little bit because this whole insurance this whole insulin thing kind of hurt I was like whoa I'm paying an extra $200 every three months now for this insurance.

265
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:42,000
For my insulin I'd hate to see you know the pumps kind of go in that way and I'd hope that pump companies aren't having like.

266
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Back door conversations with insurance companies creating deal like is that what's happening.

267
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Is that how like how did tiers even happen.

268
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Why do certain insurance companies have a tier one and tier three are they having like.

269
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Conversations with these companies like oh we'll we'll support you tier one make it the cheapest option but.

270
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Like in some sort of back door conversation.

271
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's not really even back door it's like you put in your bids you know and then.

272
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I didn't auction now yeah our health is now is an auction I'm happy about that.

273
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Yeah so everybody each manufacturer is going to put it in their bid and then have some discussions around like where you know you want to be or where you could potentially be I think you'll see.

274
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Most of the manufacturers say you know we don't really want to be like a jerk on the end I think most people remember.

275
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I was at tandem when metronic.

276
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Did that exclusive deal with united healthcare and that was.

277
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You know an outrage because you had 44 million.

278
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You know UHC customers that could now I might get.

279
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Metronic insulin pump and that went on for you know several years before that that was removed and what happened.

280
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Well you know tandem eventually you know got coverage I think it was.

281
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
You know a few years later but it was just.

282
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You know it was it was not good for anyone I was a lot of outrage in the community.

283
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:24,000
People that used UHC or employer groups and so I I would hope that after that experiment I think that was 2016.

284
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I'm I'm an optimist by.

285
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:34,000
By you know by nature so I'm going to choose to say we're we're going to continue to have some sort of choice that's still affordable.

286
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Someone told me and I I'd have to double check this that united healthcare was like dropping coverage for omnipot dash and focusing only on omnipot five.

287
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:51,000
A lot of people are still using dash with their you know DIY systems some people are just on dash and want to stay on it.

288
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Do you think they've learned their lesson like what happened there you think.

289
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Well I think from the last time to this time.

290
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:10,000
The the demand for demand for dash may not be as large as you know at that time when the UHC did that with metronica.

291
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I think metronics maybe had 45 40% of the market so.

292
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,000
In this case I don't know that dash is getting that much utilization and so with a.

293
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Somebody in the modeling department probably it after this is true probably looked at it and said.

294
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:36,000
We put those dashes in the omnipot five we can get more units and then get more utilization and maybe get better pricing.

295
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Per unit right so.

296
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:47,000
That's kind of how they think it in modeling turns to be able to get a cheaper rate for.

297
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
For the number for the downstream customer yeah as a patient.

298
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
That frustrates me to hear right because it's just profits over care like.

299
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:05,000
The patients that are using dash are using it for reason many of them may be using it for DIY systems that give them the best outcomes so.

300
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
For the decision like that to be made without consulting your patients is.

301
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
As a gut punch and.

302
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I hope that.

303
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Isn't true that they're doing that but I mean that's it's what I heard or what could be happening so.

304
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
You know what to be completely transparent with all of the people that you made at a pdn are.

305
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Very clinical their pharmacists and so like they would have to feel really strongly to to do it meaning like they must have looked at some clinical battle to say all right like.

306
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Typically this is going to make more sense and so they kind of balance like I heard a clinician from one of the big pdm speak and she was like we look at everything clinically first.

307
00:42:50,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And then we started making evaluations on either economics thereafter and so it had to have been a situation where they weren't getting much in terms of like utilization and then.

308
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I get it like the their ability to know the nuances of the DIY and where people might be married to that technology I think is probably a different case right so.

309
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
No they would probably argue like.

310
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:23,000
They were driving down price right and that gives you a lower copay or gives you employer better.

311
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Whatever it may be.

312
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I don't care what the price my employer's paying.

313
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I care the copay staying the same it you know that all the prices are in the background it's just I see the the front facing copay of course that affects premium so maybe I do care.

314
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
It all you know it all come back.

315
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Are there any benefits to this whole shift of pharmacy benefits that we didn't quite cover that you know because we got kind of depressing a little bit.

316
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Are there any other benefits that we didn't get that we didn't cover.

317
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Yeah, I think just briefly covering you touched on as you know the technology piece of it's going to force everyone to be better and I think that's better for patients.

318
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Lower copays again that's spendable wallet for the for people living with T1 days is important and then being able to continue to drive you know innovation so.

319
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I'm really optimistic about it's really the reason I'm here.

320
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It's the kind of.

321
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I would say put a bow on and really the diabetes career for me I.

322
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:43,000
You know, you know, had to sit in front of families and positions and then I've set in front of health plans and then now I'm really on the PB on PBM and trying to to drive this through and.

323
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But a lot of us are CEO Sean saint is a.

324
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
You know, a type one and, you know, for him.

325
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I think he looks at this is as a calling as well.

326
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So it's like.

327
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Is it easy to use how much easier can we get it to you know, how and then is it affordable.

328
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
So being here at this time.

329
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I think it's exciting times for for diabetes tech.

330
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Yeah, I'm hopeful for it. I mean, there there are so many benefits to it and I think the innovation part of it and making all of the pumps so easily accessible.

331
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
In a way that all the companies feel like, oh, we got to work faster.

332
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:35,000
To, you know, make ourselves more desirable. We even had an episode with beta bionics about all the innovations that have been coming in moving quickly because.

333
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:51,000
You are doing a lot over there and I'd love to see that speed of innovation happen as quickly at other companies. So the idea of, you know, more, you know, fire under each of you and to to encourage you to be better.

334
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
You know, I'd love to see that.

335
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,000
For any patients or providers that are listening.

336
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:10,000
To as like the landscape changes, how can they know what is available to them via pharmacy benefits.

337
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Yeah, I would reach out to their manufacturer or if they're interested in a manufacturer and want to try something else.

338
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I would reach out to them and have them run your pharmacy benefits.

339
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
As it sits today, right, like you can kind of move around, you may see.

340
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
You know, we're at turns into like a year commitment. That's not really going to be anything from us.

341
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
It's probably just more as the channel muchers.

342
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:47,000
But as it sits today, I would reach out to your manufacturer and say, will you run my pharmacy benefits? I'd like to try the island or I'd like to try this device.

343
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Thanks, Jeff. This was this was an awesome conversation. I'm hopeful. I'm cautiously optimistic.

344
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I see a lot of good here, and I'm excited to kind of, I'm excited for myself to have more options to be able to switch around and make more fun videos.

345
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
So thanks again for coming on.

346
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Yeah, thanks for having me and always reach out with any questions. I love what you're doing.

347
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I obviously now I'm a loyal follower, and so it's my family. So my family. So my family.

348
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Yeah, no, we enjoy it. Thank you for doing the work.

349
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I love it. Of course.

350
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Thanks for listening. I hope you enjoyed the episode. Let me know what your thoughts are on this shift in the comments.

351
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
What is your experience been with DME and Pharmacy benefits?

352
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I want to hear your pros and cons. Maybe that even becomes like this bigger video where I shared your comments.

353
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,000
New episode to this release every Monday on podcast platforms and on YouTube and video. I'm Justin, and I'll see you next week.
