Hey guys, it's Justin and I just got the Philips Hue Bluetooth Capable Lightbulbs in the mail.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,840
Thank you so much Philips Hue. I am so excited to try these out.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,840
These are the first bulbs that Philips has ever made with Bluetooth Capabilities,

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,960
so that you can connect your phone instantly to these lightbulbs and start creating scenes.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,360
For the first time, you won't need a bridge connected to your modem, you will be able to connect

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,880
to your lightbulbs instantly over Bluetooth and control them and create cool scenes.

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,920
Let's try these out.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:40,320
First, I have the white and color ambience, lightbulb right here, and it has the Bluetooth

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,160
capabilities right in the corner. You're going to want to look for that. Then I have the white

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,280
ambience, which basically allows you to do warm white and cool daylight, basically switch between

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,720
those two on a color wheel. This one's a little more expensive than this one, which is the simple

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,200
light light bulb. It only gives you a soft light. You're not going to be able to change

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,640
the different type of light you are going to be able to obviously dim it up and down.

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,480
So, these are the three bulbs I have right there. Behind me, I have three lamps. They have

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,800
light bulbs right now, while I'm taking those out, I'm putting these Philips Hue bulbs in them,

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,000
and trying them out. Also, this right here, that's a canister lamp. I really love that for accident

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
landing. I'll throw a link to that in the description below. Let's open them up and try them out.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,640
Here are the three bulbs. They're all the same size. They all look exactly the same. Thank goodness,

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,360
though. They put the names on them right in front. So, I won't have any issues knowing which one's which.

20
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,400
Thank you Philips. Appreciate it. I'm going to now put these bulbs in the lamps behind me,

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,800
and let's check out how it works with the app, set them up, and play around them.

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,600
Over here, we have the hue white and color ambience. Then we have hue white right here,

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,399
and then the hue white ambience. Okay, so this one will be able to go between different

24
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,399
colors between different types of white. This one will just stick with that white, and this one will

25
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,400
have whites and colors. So, now I'm going to open up the new Philips Hue Bluetooth app and set them up

26
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,440
over Bluetooth. So, I'm going to open up the Philips Hue app and click get started.

27
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:25,920
And I'll put my name in there and my email address. All right next. Add hue Bluetooth lights. Let's do it.

28
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,760
All right, so it's searching for my lights.

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:39,600
Bluetooth pairing will pass to you lamp. Would like to pair. Let's do it.

30
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,920
All right, which one is that up? There it is. Found the first one. All right, so let's call this one

31
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:59,359
for the purposes of the video white ambience. That's a special white ambience, right?

32
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,080
Yep, right. So, there's my white ambience. I'm going to pair another one. Wow, I already

33
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,160
love how simple this is. So, let's see. Now I'm going to come up. There's my second one. I'm switching

34
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:19,360
between the two different types of white. Love it. Wow, I'm already impressed by how quickly this is

35
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,560
moving. All right, I'm going to call this one just white. Oh, wait a second.

36
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:36,320
I put the lights in the wrong bulbs. So, I made a mistake. This one is actually the white ambience.

37
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:46,960
So, I'm going to call this one white ambience real. Classic me. All right.

38
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,520
And then we're going to pair the last one, which is, oh, this is the colored one. I got that one.

39
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:01,440
I should, oh, let's retry that connection. Okay, lost the first second. And let's call this color.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,760
So, I love this. You're a huge Bluetooth lights. You have just installed these

41
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,320
lights. Do you need to add more? The answer is no, because I only have three Bluetooth ones. So, done.

42
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:21,760
Wow, that's it. Done. All right, real quick. Let me change these names back to

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,440
what they should be because I messed that up.

44
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:32,320
All right. So, it was really easy to set up the lights. That was extremely easy. Actually, I

45
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,039
made it kind of harder for myself because I messed up those two white bulbs. But, got it down, changed the

46
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:42,159
names. And I love the layout. This is pretty great. I had the list form here where I could see the

47
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:50,159
lights that I have. And I can tap each one individually, like the white ambience and move it around.

48
00:04:50,160 --> 00:05:00,000
And we put it to cool for now. Put it to cool. And then I can go back to the list and I can

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,680
do it. And I'm also going to turn off that light one, why not? Put that up. And then I'm going to go to the

50
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:17,360
color and change it to a pink. Raise it up a little more. And then I can always turn off all lights before

51
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,600
put it back on that top right corner. I like that easy. And then I can go into the middle,

52
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,760
this palette, and choose from a bunch of defaults and seasons and some light. So, that's cool too. So,

53
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:37,120
I'll put on an energize. Right? I can go through those. And then I can add one. Let's add one. Let's try that.

54
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:44,480
So, I'm going to call this party mode just easy. I'll need one eventually. And then so what I'll

55
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:52,560
do is I'll treat the color. We'll be, I'm going to make the color, the pink. And then for the white,

56
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:59,920
I'm going to make that actually white ambience and then dim. And I really love how on top it's showing like

57
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:06,160
kind of the color scheme of the party mode. I'm going to make it a little warmer. And then save that.

58
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,680
And let's see where that went. Your seams. That's great. Awesome. So, I have to say,

59
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,120
I'm really pleased with Phillips Hughes Bluetooth light bulbs. You saw it yourself. It literally took

60
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:25,280
me seconds to set up three bulbs with one, two, three. And now I'm in this app. And I can control all of them.

61
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,840
So, I am going to set them up with my bridge later. But I just want to just show you guys kind of how the

62
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,680
Bluetooth works. This is really great for like a parent or someone who's really not technologically

63
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,440
savvy. Like everyone can do this. All right. So, there you have it guys. Those are the Phillips

64
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,800
you Bluetooth smart lights. I have to say, I am extremely, extremely happy with the simplicity of

65
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,360
setup process and how easy it is to kind of understand the app and create settings. I highly recommend

66
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,120
these light bulbs for anyone who doesn't want to get all the whole Phillips you family, which honestly,

67
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,400
I'm sure will go Bluetooth completely, eventually. Seems like that's where they're heading. All right.

68
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,840
So, that's all I have on Phillips Hughes for now. That is the Bluetooth light bulb. I'm throwing links

69
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,840
to all of these bulbs in the description below so that you can check them out. Highly recommend them. Also,
