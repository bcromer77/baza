1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
And can you kind of explain to us what that early night scout set up required?

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
This was the rig.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,160
That was what, because it was, yeah, to put all this stuff together, it was a night scout

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
rig.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,160
I came up with this.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,920
This is actually a Cabela's tackle box, foam padded, and you could cut out the foam to

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,760
do various things, fairly bomb proof, and then had another layer of foam in the bottom for

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,760
the foam.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,680
So there's this whole thing, none of it moved once the lid was shut and clamped.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,920
It's got worked by connecting CTM device from Dexcom, right?

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,320
So this is a USB on the go cable.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,000
This cable was designed originally to allow you to use things like external keyboard with

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
an Android phone.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,879
Android is doing some pretty cool stuff with their phone devices, and on the other end of it is

15
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,160
sort of your standard USB jack.

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,080
And this actually had another dongle, and I'm realizing I'm missing another piece of this puzzle.

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,440
I had to go from that, and it had to basically go through this dongle into an Android phone

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,720
or Android tablet, and it typically, that was another connection.

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,080
That device basically tricked the CTM into a constant download, and then every five minutes

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,480
it would upload that single data point to your night scout database in the cloud.

21
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,640
And so, at the bare minimum, you had it.

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,840
The candy bar device, and then you had, you know, and I'll just go my phone in here, you had

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,720
a foam plugged in.

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,440
I can't tell you how long we ran this.
