00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,560
Hey, it's Justin Tech, and I'm at the Panasonic Gooth at CES, where I got to get a

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:19,960
sleep peak into the future with their VR glasses.

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,880
One of the most unexpected announcements at CES 2020 was Panasonic's VR glasses.

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,919
Panasonic has developed the world's first high dynamic range capable, ultra HD virtual reality

5
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:32,920
glasses.

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,080
That's right, eyeglasses.

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,000
These bad boys are smaller than any VR headset I've ever worn.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,280
Not only are they incredibly small, but they've got a cool steam punk design.

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,519
The devices equipped with a micro OLED panel and earbuds capable of rich and dynamic

10
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:49,519
sound.

11
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:53,640
The glasses weren't on display at the booth, but I somehow managed to go behind the scenes

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,640
and try them out.

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,160
Look at me, I was overcome with joy and dancing all the way there.

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,120
Right now, I'm about to try out the Panasonic VR glasses, not many people have had their hands

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,040
on these and lucky enough to try them out, so here it goes.

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,800
The pair I tried were a prototype.

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,040
They looked the same as these, but they were tethered to a computer and a little front heavy.

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,280
The micro OLED panels were smaller than I expected, and displayed a square image with a much smaller

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,400
field of view at 70 degrees.

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,040
Panasonic says they can eventually get this to 100 degrees with larger panels.

21
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,840
I tried a couple experiences.

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,840
First was a video trailer, and the video was incredibly crisp.

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,440
Next I took a tour of a Japanese temple.

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,680
As I slowly moved around the temple and looked around, I was encapsulated by the most vivid

25
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,240
colors and taken it back as light beautifully reflected off the golden environment.

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,840
Trying out these glasses was a peek into the future.

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,480
Panasonic isn't likely to sell these anytime soon, but they design them in anticipation

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,320
for the 5G network.

29
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,440
They say the glasses will offer anything from VR sports viewing to virtual travel experiences.

30
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,520
When it comes to size, these glasses have me so excited for the future of VR, AR, and special computing

31
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,520
headsets.

32
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,280
Hopefully headsets like the Oculus Quest and magically will get smaller over time.

33
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,320
If you want to see more of my VR videos, I threw some links in the description, and for

the bell for alerts.

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,400
Oh, and if you enjoyed the video, why don't you give me a like?

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,120
I'm Justin, and I'll take you later.
