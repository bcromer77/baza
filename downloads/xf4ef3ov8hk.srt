00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,360
Hello and welcome to Diabetic. I'm Justin and today I'm doing a tandem mobile site change

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:13,800
If you're new here, welcome on here. I talk all things diabetes tech tips and research and I'm doing a bunch of mobile content

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:20,120
I've been wearing it for just over two months now and I was using omnipotte for the last few years

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:25,860
I wanted to try a tube pump. So today we're doing a site change and I've got a lot more coming for you

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,740
So stay tuned to the end where I'm gonna get into all the content coming out

6
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:35,900
And this video just like my others is not medical advice and is for educational purposes only

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,720
Always consult with your physician before making changes to your health care

8
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,220
Good that little pump. It is a tube pump and right here

9
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:51,500
I've got everything we need for the site change. We have a cartridge which holds up to 200 units of insulin and

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,880
And an infusion set. There are a couple options with mobile 23 inches or five inches today

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,780
We're putting on a five inch which is nice because you can just have the mobile clip or even at here to the body

12
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,900
Like right near the infusion site and it's a very small tube. Actually go on right here

13
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:15,580
Look at that. That is the five inch tube. It's super small and you can just you know kind of have it

14
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,420
Stay all together. So let's do this. I've already

15
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:26,340
Removed the cartridge from it. So this is what it looks like is out of cartridge. This is where all the brains are

16
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,020
I've got the app open up on my phone and it says to remove the cartridge did that already

17
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:41,460
And you use face ID to continue and next it wants us to open next. We've got to fill up the cartridge. So let's do that

18
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,520
Right, so the first thing we want to do is put some insulin into the cartridge. I'm gonna take this

19
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,420
wipe clean up the insulin vial

20
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,140
Put the vial on top of here and then here. I'll just pull out

21
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,460
Insulin

22
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,220
And then what I

23
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,380
To get the air out. I tap on here a little bit push it up

24
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,060
Try to get all those champagne bubbles out

25
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,780
And then don't have much left in this vial, but I think I can get exactly how much I need

26
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,420
We go sweet

27
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,980
We have got the insulin in the cartridge. So take this off and then

28
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,820
Take this out take this a little piece out

29
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,540
That's all garbage

30
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:47,140
On twist this little top part and there you go. That is the cartridge right now. I'll take this cartridge and I'll put it right on the pump

31
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,540
Twist it in and there you go. Next we've got to

32
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,380
Connect the tubing to the pump

33
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:02,180
To the cartridge now we've got to connect the infusion set the tube

34
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,380
This is short little five inch tube to the pump

35
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,980
Like so

36
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,980
There we go

37
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,580
We've got the pump and the tube and then the next thing you have to do is you have to get insulin through the tube

38
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,620
Just hold that here and then that you use the app for so once that's connected

39
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:30,260
You want to continue and then you're what you're gonna do is you're gonna hold the button on the pump

40
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,780
And it's going to work to get insulin through the tube. I usually find that I have to do this a couple times

41
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,740
You don't want to keep your eye off of the

42
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,980
little needle here because that's where the insulin's gonna come up and as soon as you see

43
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,540
Drops no drops yet. That's when you stop. So note

44
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,700
Let's do it again. I'm sure we're gonna see them and he's second now

45
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,740
Interesting I didn't see it again, so I'm gonna do it one more time

46
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,660
Usually I feel like I get it in that second time

47
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:22,900
Oh, I see it from there. There you go. You can actually see it through go through the tube and into this little piece right here

48
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:29,060
So there you go. There's a little drop of insulin and we are ready to go. I feel like when I first started doing site changes

49
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,180
But maybe it felt like a lot, but the more I've done it the more simple it's become

50
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,740
so

51
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:44,820
That's going through great so now I just have to put it on so next what you want to do is you want to

52
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:51,860
Take off this little blue safety cap. So you don't want to do it. I just did which was pull it up and luckily

53
00:04:51,860 --> 00:05:00,260
I was able to get it back down. So I almost want to hold this down as I'm hold down on this like piece as I'm taking off the blue

54
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
cap

55
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,740
Then

56
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,740
You rip off this

57
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,740
Then you take that off which will reveal the sticky part look at that so you can see that

58
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:17,140
The actual needle and surrounding that is the cannula and then you've got a sticky part as well

59
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,740
That's what's going to stick to my body

60
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,380
Next you want to take off this back piece of paper

61
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,780
This will unveil the

62
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:35,060
Contraption to put it on and then from here there are ridges on either side you kind of hold onto those

63
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,380
So you're going to pull up on these ridges and pull this back there we go

64
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,460
There we go. I got it and now I have this piece that is ready to be

65
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:54,260
Put into my skin so you can see the needle sticking through again and then there's these little ridges which is where the tube goes

66
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,900
So I want the tube to go downward. So I'm going to

67
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,219
Put it in like this so that the tube is sticking down

68
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,740
So before I actually use that I'm going to get this piece

69
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,940
This alcohol swab

70
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,700
So I'm going to have it go right here. I'm going to let it dry first and then also what I'm going to do it

71
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:24,820
I'm going to take this clip. This is the clip for mobile. I'm actually going to clip this and I think

72
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,140
And then

73
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:34,020
Clip the mobile so that I'm not like having it way down on me. I feel like after going from tubeless with omnipot to mobile

74
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,620
That switch has been tough for me. It's just been a lot of

75
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:44,340
The dangling parts that I'm not used to because with omnipot you could just put the pump on and then it does it itself

76
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:51,540
I have a video of my how to do an infusion site change with omnipot on this YouTube channel if you want to check that up. So anyway

77
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,780
Let's do this

78
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,980
So I'll put the pump there

79
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,500
Clip down and then this is where I clean it so there's a little ridge here

80
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,900
So I'm going to put that ridge down and then this is where I'm going to have the pump go

81
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:11,540
Now there's two little hand pieces on either side or finger pieces that you're going to push in so ready

82
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,540
I'm going to push these in

83
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:23,140
And it's in then I push down on this to make sure that the adhesive is sticking and then just pull this up

84
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,740
And there you go. I've got a new site

85
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,260
You can see the little kneel

86
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,260
in there

87
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,780
and

88
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,300
Yeah, that is a tandem mobile site change

89
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,940
I've got a lot of tandem mobile content that's already out coming out on my social and diabet underscore tech

90
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:50,659
And also here on YouTube I've got a video that's all about like going from the tubeless omnipot to tube and

91
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,340
All of the

92
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,820
Interesting things and the frustration things that have come out of that. Oh, I guess I should finish this on the app

93
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,460
And a review for tandem mobile coming out

94
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,180
And there we go. I am good

95
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:08,180
And then I'm also you always want to make sure that automation's back on it usually asks in my case it is

96
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,220
I'm just going to give myself a little insulin because I need it

97
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,700
I was high I did not want to film this

98
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:19,540
But I was highly at night and I needed to film my next site change and that's right now anyway

99
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,460
I hope you enjoyed this video. I hope you learned something if you want to learn more about mobile

100
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,980
Make sure you subscribe to this channel watch my stuff on social media and give this video a like if you enjoyed it

101
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,460
I'm Justin and I'll take you later
