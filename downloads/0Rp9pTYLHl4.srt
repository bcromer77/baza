00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Today, we are traveling back to a time before automated insulin pumps.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Before CGMs had follower apps, back when viewing glucose data remotely felt impossible.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Until a passionate group of developers and parents said,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
we are not waiting and built the tools themselves.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Welcome to Diabetic. I'm Justin. I have Type 1 Diabetes and on here,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I talk all things Diabetes Tech, news and innovation, and the people behind it.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In this episode, we are diving into the open source movement that helped revolutionize diabetes care.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And specifically, we're focusing on night scout.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A platform that's become a staple in the community for uploading and tracking diabetes data.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Today, I'm speaking with James Wedding, the founder of the night scout foundation,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
about the early days of night scout, the energy and the innovations coming out of the open source community,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
what it was like raising a kid at a time before remote monitoring and how homegrown solutions

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
sparked a worldwide community and pushed industry players like Dexcom to work faster.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We get into how night scout enabled people to view their CGM data on smartwatches and tablets.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The taskbar on the Macbook and the rig behind the early day setup,

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
what people needed to carry around in order to use this,

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and why night scout's work is still so important today.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This is an incredible story. It's one piece of the we are not waiting movement.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I've covered lots of areas of this, whether it be the origins of DIY loop and automated insulin system

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
for iPhone that's been around since before FDA cleared systems could automate insulin.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And I also just had episode recently with Amy Tendrich, a blogger in the early days,

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
who has held all of these conferences and events to streamline innovations.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
All of these kind of connect, so I'll put those two episodes in the show notes.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Keep in mind that all of my episodes are not medical advice and educational purposes only.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Always consult with a physician before making changes to your healthcare.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And everything DIY you do at your own risk, they're not cleared by any government organization.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's get into it.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
James, welcome to the show. It's good to have you here.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Thank you very much.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Appreciate the invitation and you're reaching out.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yeah, of course. Well, this isn't the first time we've spoken. Actually, it was maybe two years ago,

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
a little over two years ago where you messaged me because I had posted one of my like,

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
fun, like loop intro video to a face some Facebook account.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And what did you say to me?

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Something along the lines of, hey, this isn't this isn't an infotainment channel.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Keep it on topics up the wall and those lines, I'm sure.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, and it's funny. I feel like so much has changed on my end and my understanding of this community and what platforms,

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
like that that I had posted my video on, like these are all platforms that where people are helping each other.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And while I thought that this video, I think actually it was like an interview video.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
While it was a good story in people in that, you know, Facebook group probably would have enjoyed it.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I understand you wanting to keep it like this is a place where people are helping each other and giving tips and, you know,

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
please don't use this as a promotion platform, you know. So I just think it's so funny because we are reconnected and I looked back at our messages on Facebook and I was like,

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
oh my goodness, I remember like you calling me out on that.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah, I just for the record. I did not call you out on that. I had people message me to call you out. Oh wow.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I was, no, I, those groups are so big like K and West and I and other people who might write them, we can't police.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And so what we respond to are people saying, hey, somebody sent this message, somebody posted this junk for sale, somebody did whatever and we always go, okay, we'll go take a look and,

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and again, I think if you insert the time was, hey, this isn't the right place, but here's the three other places.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's in really well. Exactly. And you hit it there, and again, I know you talked with Stacey Sims that was like, hey, so, so give you the lay of the land and how we play

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
with with those sorts of podcast or new videos or new apps that people produce.

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And yeah, we're, great. And you found a great audience. I know the loop and learn folks have have jumped on and subscribed. I'm sure.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah, absolutely. And your name has come up a fair amount of time throughout past interviews and conversations. Like you have been around for some time in the whole open source DIY community.

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And your story is so fascinating. I'm so excited for everyone to hear about it and ask you even more questions than I did in our like prior call.

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But kind of just start us out with how you entered this world of diabetes. You don't have diabetes yourself, right? It was your child that was diagnosed.

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Correct. My daughter is 22 now diagnosed 11. And really, my wife, like, like happens a lot of couples, honestly. My wife handled much of the diabetes responsibility for the first few years.

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And I kind of flitted around the edges. Every time we get a new technology announcement or somebody would have a breathless new FDA posting, I kind of look at it and go, yeah, that's still garbage on now.

56
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And then John Costa posted a picture of what I think was a double watch and showed a single blood glucose reading on it.

57
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And my wife is like, okay, this is new. This is different. You need to figure this out. And I message them. And basically it was I'm still working on it. It's not ready for general consumption.

58
00:05:48,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But watch this space. And you know, I actually went and looked back that that was 2014. So now 11 years and change Jason Adams started the CGM in the cloud group in April that year.

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And by May, I was in there poking around and asking questions and trying to figure out how to get how to get this really, you know, first was clearly selfish. How do I get this from my daughter and from my wife and I said, we can sleep at night.

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah, and before you connected with them, this is 2014.

61
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Right. How long had your daughter been diagnosed?

62
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Uh, that was about three years in. If I remember. Okay. Got you.

63
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Got you. February 2011. She's sitting right behind me. She'll tell me if I'm wrong. But it was about three years in.

64
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And as a parent, what was managing diabetes like at that time at a time where there was no remote monitoring of right glucose numbers.

65
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Uh, there was a whole lot of of of of hope and a prayer and a whole lot of phone calls and a whole lot of would you please keep an eye on this for me and and those sorts of things.

66
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You know, you're talking about sending kids to our elementary school and even worse for kids who are preverbal.

67
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Right. And and you're giving them a finger Pope. You're writing down a number.

68
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,000
If you're working with a school or a daycare, you're hoping that maybe they'll send you a text or they'll call you with a number and then you kind of go, okay, I've got one data point.

69
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't know how much they're running around. I don't know if they actually ate everything. It was in the launch.

70
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't know how they're feeling and you would just.

71
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah, it was it was a lot and and I think there's lots of parents who can tell you about the days of.

72
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Every day picking a kid up from school from daycare and saying, how is it? How are you feeling? How's your number? You know, it just.

73
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
There were CGMs, but they were attached.

74
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So even if you are on a CGM and a lot of people weren't because they were still fairly limited. It feels like in in access.

75
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You are still depending on someone to get access to that data and share it with you as a parent, whether you were at school or work or traveling or whatever else.

76
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What are the CGMs like?

77
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I mean, it was a text come for G4 when we first got on.

78
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay, so funny enough, I actually have like, and we'll talk about this whole box later, but I mean, it's this thing, right?

79
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So this is an old G4, but you're talking about like a small cell phone, you know, like a candy bar size device that this kid has to walk around with.

80
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And then you give it to a daycare provider or a teacher or whatever.

81
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And you, again, you hope that communicated back with you.

82
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The device itself worked fine, but the the information was only accessible about six feet away.

83
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So so what, right, then what do you do?

84
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I mean, that really makes me appreciate what we're working with now, which is Bluetooth 35 feet away.

85
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The small little thing on me, it's connected to my phone.

86
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So with the CGM your daughter was wearing the G4.

87
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Right. What was it just like a little sensor on the skin?

88
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It didn't have any wires or anything. It wasn't connected.

89
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It was untethered from that.

90
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay.

91
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It was it was Bluetooth and it was about the size of.

92
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Oh, I guess about half, you know, a half dollar and.

93
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay.

94
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Relatively small until you put it on a eight year old with skin yops or, you know, an infant, you know, think about some of these people who've been wearing these cents.

95
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So the signs as it has shrunk over the years has been pretty dramatic, but that was never concerned.

96
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It was just the limitation of the data and where you could access it that really drove all of this development, all this community.

97
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:52,000
All these parents, all these people affected by diabetes with the inability to remote monitor glucose levels, which is something that we so take for granted nowadays.

98
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You enter this group, right? You enter this group on Facebook, CGM, the cloud.

99
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Some work had already been going on when you had entered in.

100
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What was the energy like in there?

101
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh, wow.

102
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Pure excitement.

103
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
A little bit of chaos.

104
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
A little bit of.

105
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I can't believe we're actually doing this and I can't believe it's taking us to figure this out.

106
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And I can't believe they're not giving this to us.

107
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:34,000
A lot of frustration because it was, wait a minute, why are we having to do this? Why is it this coming out of the box? Why isn't this something that, you know, I guess, you know, we were ducks come people.

108
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So, you know, why is it ducks come doing this? Why? Why am I?

109
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You know, and I think I told Stacy years ago on, you know, one of her initial conversations we had.

110
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The day that DIY doesn't have to do development and diabetes, I'll be over the moment.

111
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
None of us really have, especially originally, none of us wanted to do this.

112
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It was just something like, well, if you're not going to do what I will.

113
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And I'll do it from my kid and I'll take care of my problems.

114
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And then, you know, from then it became very quickly, I pay it forward.

115
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay, I got it working for my kid. I got it working for myself and my loved ones can keep an eye on me, whatever.

116
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
How can I help other people? And really make it more accessible and make this.

117
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So, you don't have to be a developer. I mean, that first month I go back and I look and it's been west and Kevin Lee and these guys.

118
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And we can run through the names later. I can never thank them all enough.

119
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But they were all really technologically savvy development side folks.

120
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And so, you had to have sort of a fundamental either faith in your own ability to figure it out.

121
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Or you needed to be able to read what they were writing and understand it.

122
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And there was sort of this first pass evolution of when night scout became something that went from,

123
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I really got to be a coder to, okay, clear instructions are step by step.

124
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
There's hardware to buy and we could spell it out.

125
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And you can go back and look. I think that summer I put videos on YouTube on how to set this stuff up.

126
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And that transition from a developer DIY, you know, hacker mentality to something on, okay, if you can put together a bookshelf from IKEA, you can do this.

127
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And that was sort of that first big transition.

128
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And that was excitement. I mean, there are, there are posts, you go back west, northern, one of the first things he would do.

129
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Sort of his claim to fame is he would give everybody the little night scout wings meme.

130
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
When they would come in the group and say, I got it working. I got it working. And he would give them a little sort of wings because it was it was it was work.

131
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But it was so exciting and it was so fulfilling the first time you were like, I see the numbers. I see this data. I see myself or my loved one or my kid.

132
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It was, it was.

133
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's still get recledited. It was so exciting. It was great.

134
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Why do you kind of just explain to everyone what night scout is exactly?

135
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Sure. So night scout originally was designed as a way to get CGM data unlocked from that little candy bar device that we were looking at earlier.

136
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It was a way to take the readings from a CGM and basically put them in a web service where you could access them whether through a web browser or again at the time.

137
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It really was pebble watches. They had a very DIY Kickstarter figure out mentality and they had enough open API enough open programming resources for giving me for dripping in the text speak.

138
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
They made resources available so that you could put data on their watches.

139
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And so John figure out how to get to that point and then it became okay. Now we've got remote monitoring whether it is on a laptop or watch another computer.

140
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Another small Android tablet, whatever it might be.

141
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And then it evolved again because people then said, okay, now I've got data. What else can I do with it?

142
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And really now night scout has become sort of this default communication protocol for anybody who wants to talk about diabetes data.

143
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Whether it is CGM, right? That's the first easy obvious stuff, right? That's where we started.

144
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But then it became, I want to log insulin. I want to log my rapid acting. I want to log the overnight injection mixture. I got that.

145
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I want to log snacks and meals and I'm going to go for a bike ride for 30 minutes and it became a logging tool that wasn't tied to either bad apps or were tied to apps produced by medical providers.

146
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:48,000
We're like, well, what are you going to do with my data? And now it's, it's the background for so many things.

147
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And again, it's become sort of a default language. So if you want to build an app or want to build a resource that leverages data about type ones.

148
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Night scout is a great place to start and it's not everything needs night scout, but almost everything can leverage night scout to extend whatever they're doing.

149
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So, you know, I set up my own night scout. There's a link I go to that is a, there's some sort of platform, like, is someone running the night scout platform or is this some sort of self sustaining

150
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Website you're able to get into. I know there are different platforms that you can pay in order to just host it.

151
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But I mean, like, night scout as a platform is that being run by anyone or it kind of just like lives it exists that people can enter into.

152
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:48,000
A little bit of both. I mean, it is a open source project and people can make request to update and change that code base.

153
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The challenge, honestly, at this point is worth 10 years in and it has been.

154
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Essentially built from the ground up a couple of times by various developers who say, okay, support for older technologies has started to weigh us down.

155
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
When you need to refactor, we need to restart this code base.

156
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The challenge now is because it's become sort of this link with Frank that everybody sort of scared to do that because you're afraid of what can break, right?

157
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And it's not just what are you going to break in your world.

158
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And so it's become a little heavy. It is it is self sustaining. It's a little bit.

159
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:36,000
There's still lots of work to be done. There's still lots of effort out there. You know, been west is constantly doing things to mainline to update and bring things up to.

160
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You know, a more modern version, you know, he's done a lot of work. He's one of the hosting services you talk about, you know, he's done a lot of work to make it more scalable.

161
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So that when you are looking at hosting services, you know, it's not quite as heavy on the back end for those people providing that.

162
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So it can be a little bit more cost effective and do those sorts of things.

163
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So it's certainly not, it's not moving as fast as it does, but it really doesn't have to because people are doing other stuff now with it.

164
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's become the common data environment that then other people go out and do other things with.

165
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And that to me is pretty powerful. The fact that, you know, again, this is a loving year old tech that continues to resonate and ripple.

166
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And people find creative ways to leverage that data and go out and do things that matter to them and not just necessarily to share holders of some massive medical device company.

167
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:43,000
This episode is sponsored by OmniPod. As someone with T1D and with an incredibly active lifestyle, it's important for me not to get tied up, especially with tubes on my insulin pump.

168
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I love to go swimming, lift weights and play kickball with friends.

169
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And with OmniPod 5, I never have to worry about tubes getting in the way.

170
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Plus, not having to disconnect helps me to stay in range during all of my favorite physical activities. That includes sexy time too.

171
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:11,000
See, if you're eligible for a 30 day trial by visiting OmniPod.com slash dive attack on there, you'll see full safety and risk information and trial terms at OmniPod.com slash dive attack.

172
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Yeah, tell me about those earlier days when you were in that group.

173
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Tell me about some of those people that were in those chats and the projects that they were working on.

174
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Sure, I mean, I go back and I think about, you know, sort of there was this this cohort of early developers Lane Desboro, you know, really sort of put out the rally cry of we are not waiting at one of the data that hosted by Amy Tindridge.

175
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And that became the catalyst for early hands like, okay, we're not going to wait, we're going to do this ourselves.

176
00:18:45,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And then you know, he was working with Ben West and Ross Nailer was was working on Ross and Kevin really worked on the first Android application that would plug into that CDM and send that data to the cloud because you had to get from that candy bar again somehow you had to get to the web.

177
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So they were building an Android uploader is what it was just it was just called an uploader and you know, again, I'm trying not to forget anybody.

178
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Jason Calabrecy and you know, all these folks that were really started and it's funny because Jason Adams first got into this news.

179
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Like, okay, I'm not a techie.

180
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:32,000
He actually, he actually used I think it was Amazon, what's their service web services mechanical Turk.

181
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
No, you remember you used to build it like I have an idea, I don't know how to execute it, I'm going to pay some agencies for me.

182
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And he he sent out a service that guy is guy named Raj and I was just thinking it's I haven't I haven't chat with Raj in years, I kind of wonder what he's up to Jason sent out this request.

183
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I need someone to build a night scout site for me.

184
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's a little developer heavy at this point.

185
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Raj came back and said, I don't feel like I can charge you in good faith through this, this was so simple.

186
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And so he was running around people would come in and say, hey, I want to do this.

187
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Excuse me.

188
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Sorry.

189
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
People want to do this and he was like, okay, I'll set it up for you.

190
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And he was just doing it for people out of the goodness of of his heart before he he I'm like.

191
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
He grew up and went to college and got a career and he's I'm sure he's out there doing something wonderful, but it was just.

192
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,000
This this environment of we're all for you in this out, we're all helping each other and.

193
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
We're just going to do it and at some point somebody will yell at us, but right now we're.

194
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
We're not waiting.

195
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah, and was it John Costa who.

196
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Was it his childhood was the first person ever to to be running night scout.

197
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I saw somewhere he's called the Mr. impatient.

198
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That's probably the best way to describe it. You know, I think there are again.

199
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Lane was doing something, you know, on is there were there were a lot of different things.

200
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I think John was the one that everybody rallied around and he was the first person I saw.

201
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I always hate to say, well, you know, was someone so the first.

202
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Probably, you know, it was it was such an amazing team effort.

203
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And all these people who had figured out various bits and pieces to come together.

204
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You know, and I've heard stories that like some of the initial conversations, they were like we're not having this conversation.

205
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Online.

206
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Because there were so many concerns about.

207
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What are we doing? What's the FDA going to say? What are these device manufacturers going to say are we going to, you know, are we going to Jay?

208
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I mean, nobody knew.

209
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Right? We're just sort of hacking this stuff together.

210
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,000
But there were people who were legitimately like are they going to assume me into oblivion for telling people how their stuff works.

211
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Um, you know, and I think that was even even a little bit scarier for, again, folks like Ben and.

212
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Dana and Scott Leibrand, you know, who were who were playing on the pop side of the equation and doing things there.

213
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Right? You, you've now moved from taking a data point and putting on a TV.

214
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I don't see any harm in that. That's, that's pretty easy.

215
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
To now, we're talking about algorithms for injecting insulin. That's a different game.

216
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And so all of this stuff happening in this environment in these conversations, again, it was very exciting.

217
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It was very wild west to the point and I still think a lot of us take a measure of pride in it.

218
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:39,000
There was an interview with the then CEO of Dexcom, who called us out as being a bunch of rogue cowboys.

219
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And we were kind of like, yeah, that works.

220
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
That's amazing. I love that.

221
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You showed us the little device earlier. I want you to show it to us again.

222
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Can you kind of explain to us what that early night scout set up required?

223
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Sure. Okay. So this is, you know, typically, I'm trying to, we have a clever name for this, but basically it's a box.

224
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So, so about why this box is the box.

225
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So night scout worked by connecting CTM device from Dexcom, right?

226
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So this is a USB on the go cable.

227
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,000
This cable was designed originally to allow you to use things like external keyboard with an Android phone.

228
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And going to do some pretty cool stuff with their phone devices.

229
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And on the other end of it is sort of your standard USB jack.

230
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And this actually had another dongle. I'm, I'm realizing I'm missing another piece of this puzzle.

231
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But it had to go from that and it had to basically go through this dongle into an Android phone or Android tablet.

232
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And it typically, that was another connection.

233
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That device was running the upload that I referenced Jason and Kevin really working on quite a bit.

234
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:11,000
That device basically tricked the CTM into a constant download and then every five minutes it would upload that single data point to your night scout database in the cloud.

235
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And so, at the bare minimum, you had a, the candy bar device and then you had, you know, and I'll just go my phone in here.

236
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You had a phone plugged in.

237
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
This was the rig. That was what, because it was, yeah, to put all this stuff together. It was a night scout rig. I can't believe I forgot about that.

238
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:43,000
But once you come up with that and you see people again that are adults and are running around and you see them with, you know, a phone and the little candy bar and it's bell crowed on you're like, okay, that's, that's fine.

239
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You were a grown adult, you were not going to abuse this stuff.

240
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The fourth grader going to school with a backpack and books and pens and pencils and all the junk.

241
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And so it became very much, okay, how do we protect these connections?

242
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Because you can see mine is still taped on there.

243
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Because this connection was so fragile that the first year I think we probably filed more broken USB connection complaints with Dexcom than they'd ever seen before.

244
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And so we had to tell people, okay, so when you call in your busted USB connection, you tell them it happened why you were downloading at the doctor's office.

245
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Because if you tell them you were doing it with this, they'd be like, get out.

246
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Right.

247
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Yeah.

248
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yeah.

249
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It's void.

250
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So you wind up taping these things together.

251
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I came up with this, this is actually a Cabela's tackle box.

252
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:51,000
But it is foam padded and you could cut out the foam to do various things fairly bomb proof and then had another layer of foam.

253
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Sorry, you can't see it there. Another layer of foam in the bottom for the phone.

254
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So there's this whole thing, none of it moved.

255
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Once the lid was shut and clamped.

256
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And, and did you ever have to, when did you have to open it up?

257
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
To charge.

258
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You still had to charge.

259
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You know, at night when the kids came home or whatever, you would open this up.

260
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
You would, you would unplug, you would charge things.

261
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Most of us again, once we get figured out this worked fairly well.

262
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You would have a nighttime a second Android device.

263
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And again, at the time.

264
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm going to say this and then and I fully recognize it.

265
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Like the amount of data and the number of cell phones that people went through was insane.

266
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Like, I still have a stack of Android tablets because we were trying to figure out which tablet is stable.

267
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And these were all just these cheap knock-off Android tablets that you were buying for anywhere between $49 and $100.

268
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
For nighttime, right?

269
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
They weren't cell phones.

270
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And so you would plug that in while you were charging the phone that went with the kid during the day.

271
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Wow, it was a whole production.

272
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Oh, it was absolutely production.

273
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Yeah.

274
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And, you know, it ran for, I can't tell you how long we ran this.

275
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Realistically, we ran, we never did move to the Dexcom share in the cradle.

276
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Eventually, when it became cell phone directly, that was when we got rid of the candy bar and everything.

277
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
But that box went to school with her for years.

278
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
How long did it take from the creation of that say,

279
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:40,000
for that Dexcom share feature to come out that connected to a phone that allowed you to not.

280
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
You know, I guess I have to use this for that.

281
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
You'll have to, you'll have to go back and check their release dates.

282
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It was faster than I think anybody thought it would be.

283
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You know, I think one of the things that a lot of us take pride in is that night scout rolled out.

284
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
We basically said, this is safe.

285
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
This is dumb that it's not available.

286
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
We're going to do this whether you like it or not.

287
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Again, I actually remember having a conversation with one of the C suite at Dexcom and saying,

288
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Do you know how many Dexcom units we have sold for you?

289
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Because people didn't want to pay for it.

290
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And we're not going to fight about it with their insurance provider when the data was limited to six feet.

291
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
As soon as we could make that data accessible.

292
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Kids went back on Dexcom's because now mom and dad did see adults went back on Dexcom's because now they could share that information with a spouse or a friend or something else.

293
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I mean, I said it in jazz, but I was like, you should be giving us a cut for the number of Dexcom receivers that we are selling you because now people use them.

294
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It was, it was, again, I can't tell you when the dates were.

295
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It was when the next night scout rolled and share rolled.

296
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
But I will say it was a massive update.

297
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
They really realized, I think they knew.

298
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
The folks at Dexcom are not, are not foolish.

299
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
They knew remote monitoring mattered.

300
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But other than they realized what a massive tightaway of demand was sitting behind the solution.

301
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And as soon as we started doing it, you know, I think they actually called up the FDA and said, look, these people, these rogue cowboys.

302
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Are doing this, would you please approve our version so that we can start understanding what the market is like and we can get this out there.

303
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And a quote safe and I wrote my eyes pretty hard because I'm sure that was the conversation even though I see zero safety issues with sharing CGM data.

304
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It was, it was definitely something that triggered conversations with Dexcom and at the FDA saying, you know, displaying data is not a inherent risk.

305
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And we should, we should remove these barriers and get this in the hands of people who can leverage it and make their lives better.

306
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Yeah, I mean, and now I could never imagine diabetes treatment without cloud uploads of data.

307
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I mean, definitely for parents, but even for me for all of the connections I use with my devices and.

308
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Especially with, you know, add automated algorithms to it like it's it's great that.

309
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You all pushed them to come out with this sooner because had you not been around.

310
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:38,000
This easily could have taken much longer with just people saying, please do this, you know, like, yeah.

311
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It was a, you know, we were a good bookie man to hold up to the FDA and say move this along.

312
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Because otherwise it was yeah, we'll get to it and I think they would have.

313
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I don't know if there's any malice or anything, but that's a massive bureaucracy that's got to be navigated and.

314
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You know, Dexcom being able to have have us as a as a bookie man or as a stick to beat that drum with.

315
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I think it worked out well for everybody. You know, and again, I, I their technology their team, they did great things.

316
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Yeah, but their analysis second sort of twist and white night scout continues to exist is people want to own their data.

317
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
They don't want to necessarily, especially these days feed into.

318
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Whatever giant data center that Dexcom is running, whatever giant center metronics is running with all this information.

319
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:37,000
They want to own their data and they, they don't want it necessarily, you know, I think there are still valid concerns that that data could be used against us at some point.

320
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You know, oh, hey, your insurance stream is going up. We see you run an average of X. That's not healthy. You need to go on a diet.

321
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You know, that sort of abuse is just way to happen.

322
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And you ask a little dystopian. It's probably a little paranoid, but I certainly empathize with the folks were like, yeah, I'm never sharing my data with these companies.

323
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
They will run night scout because I own my data.

324
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Yes, soon we'll be seeing a black mirror episode about it, maybe.

325
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Inquiry. Somebody's right. Really?

326
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Yeah, we already have.

327
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Yeah.

328
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It's not hard to see, right? I mean, they ask you if you smoke, they ask you if you drink too much.

329
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:25,000
You're giving them the data. It wouldn't just wouldn't be hard to see an insurance company or a state run health agency saying, hey, we, we can see you're not adhering to our rules.

330
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
That's scary. So I wanted to ask you one other thing.

331
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I about when when you first started night scout, would kind of take us into that first night that you were working on it, right?

332
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You were working with someone to get it going, right?

333
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yeah.

334
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Yeah, I am.

335
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And I actually, it may 2014.

336
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I actually went back and found one of my last sort of, hey, this isn't working.

337
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Help me figure this out.

338
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And again, it's sort of a hoos who of all these people.

339
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I posted, I had had Raj had built me a website.

340
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
We're great. I had built my own. It wasn't working.

341
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I was like, hey, here's Raj. Here's mine. What did I miss? What have I not got working right?

342
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And, you know, Lane is in there offering, you know, hey, did you test this? Did you check this?

343
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Jason Calibase is in there. You know, few other, again, these all these people that I look back now.

344
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And I'm like, these are these are absolutely heroes of this world, this community.

345
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
They are, they gave so much of themselves so much of their time to help.

346
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So many thousands of people who probably don't even know they exist.

347
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And that's, you know, that's probably all me and the rest of this world for not shouting their names a lot or not.

348
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:47,000
But sometimes, I want to say around 1230, and so my old place, I'm off this downstairs.

349
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
My Carson's room is right above me. And so I actually could sit at the desk and work on stuff and get readings.

350
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
A little little work, but it, it worked.

351
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
At some point, Ben actually, I think he actually picked up the phone and called me.

352
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Or we figured out some way and he walked me through whatever the little step was.

353
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And I think it was something I had just left out a dot in an IP address.

354
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I mean, at the time, you were literally hard coding things into the application at a code level.

355
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
You would build it and install it onto your Android phone, reboot the phone and cross your fingers.

356
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And I'm somewhere in there, I type something wrong.

357
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Ben and I added, he's walking through it. And I guess we had some sort of share screen.

358
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I don't know whether it was Zoom or what, but we sit and he's like, okay, go build.

359
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And this takes about five, eight minutes to go through this.

360
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And then you're waiting for the CGM to actually send something.

361
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So there's that five minute interval.

362
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And we're sitting there and I just, like, mid-sentence, one point popped up on my screen.

363
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And I remember like, I stopped. I went, I went speechless.

364
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And I was like, we got it.

365
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And it was such a massive cathartic moment of being like, okay.

366
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I can protect my kid now.

367
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And, you know, I think I went back and looked.

368
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
So we had these, so for me, I get with such a personal moment.

369
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And then what was amazing is that we could echo that.

370
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And we could take that and make it grow.

371
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And I don't remember when it was, I can go back and find the pictures.

372
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
One of our friends at Microsoft let us use their technology center to do a training and a setup.

373
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Probably later in that year.

374
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And we had, I think, about 20 people showed up and we built this.

375
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And it was great, like, my own feeling of relief.

376
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And, and excitement was, was amazing.

377
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:56,000
But then I think we got 16 or 17 people in that room at the same time and turned this on for them.

378
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Wow.

379
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Yeah.

380
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I don't think I've, I've done a lot of them.

381
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I think I've done a lot of approval things.

382
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Like personally I've experienced a lot of incredible things.

383
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I don't think I've ever seen that level of impact.

384
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
So many people in such a tight space in 90 minutes from the minute they walked in the door.

385
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And then there they are and they're like, this change is everything.

386
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And so that sort of momentum, that sort of built.

387
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah, it is why it's still out there.

388
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
You know, that's why I mean, I look this morning.

389
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
See even in the cloud is 40,000 people.

390
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Lupin learn is thousands of people.

391
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
There's just don't continue to be this appetite for what can we do next.

392
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And how can we make everybody's lives a little simpler?

393
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
No.

394
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Nobody's like retiring and getting rich off of these ideas and this work.

395
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And all of it is volunteers.

396
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You know, the Lupin learn group.

397
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You know, I, we helped from the night sky foundation.

398
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
We helped them with some funding and we helped them with access to technology things.

399
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:06,000
But it's still volunteers producing webcasts and newsletters and putting together links and translating things into,

400
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I don't know how many languages.

401
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And it's all just people who are like, holy cow, this changed my world.

402
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
How can I share that?

403
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Today's episode is sponsored by T1D Exchange.

404
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
You can directly make an impact on diabetes health care, treatments,

405
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
and technology by participating in the T1D Exchange registry.

406
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It starts with the simple survey about your life with T1D and it only takes about 15 minutes.

407
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
After that, you'll have a personal portal with ongoing T1D study and survey opportunities.

408
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Plus, some of these studies even offer compensation.

409
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Signing up with the link in the show notes helps support my channel and it allows me to continue putting out free content.

410
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:57,000
You can sign up at t1dxchange.org slash diabetic or click that link in today's show notes.

411
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:07,000
This community really is just so incredible and so supportive and loop and learn and all these other Facebook groups looped.

412
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Are just people who spend their free time answering questions, helping guide people to similar experiences with what you had with Ben,

413
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:27,000
just through all these groups, whatever, maybe even hopping on calls to help people get on a system that will work for them,

414
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
whether it be maybe it's loop and the fact that with the open source loop,

415
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,000
parents can not only follow their kids but they can also believe they can make dosing decisions with that.

416
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:48,000
There are still a lot of features that people are gaining access to with these softwares, especially parents.

417
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I mean, it's why I love doing what I do because,

418
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,000
yeah, even though it has, of course, it's become a business because, but it's what I do every single day.

419
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:11,000
The fact that I can create content that is helpful to people that makes their lives easier and allows them to understand like all of the devices that are available to them to better themselves.

420
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:21,000
It's so rewarding. I've never been so passionate about something and to have stumbled upon people like you who have pushed so hard already.

421
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I mean, it's just been the coolest journey for me.

422
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You know, and I want to make sure, you know, we talked about loop and learn because that's sort of a group that right now, I think is really sort of carrying the banner.

423
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,000
But I don't think, even to some extent, that exists without Kate and Katie and we talked a little bit about Kate Farmsworth.

424
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Yeah, I don't know if you ever, and maybe you did just and I don't know if you didn't get to know Katie D. Simone.

425
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:59,000
She is probably, probably, you know, in the pantheon of diabetes open source, she's a giant. She can Kate released it up looped, right?

426
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And again, it was moving it out of this isn't just about CGM access. Now we're talking about automated insulin delivery, excuse me, AIDs, you know, and made that accessible.

427
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:19,000
We talked a little bit about some of the legal concerns, the ramifications, right? And so when looping sort of became, alright, that's where the group is heavy.

428
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Remote monitoring has become something you can buy off the shelf.

429
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Looping is not off the shelf yet. Looping is still the same thing. A very conscientious decision was made to separate those conversations from the CGM in the cloud group.

430
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Because again, we were anxious and, and, you know, I think Kate and Katie really, it was their baby.

431
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:49,000
You know, they were cognizant of the fact that this is now shredding again into new water that is legally a little treacherous.

432
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And so, you know, I just assume that we can't have these conversations in CGM in the cloud group. We've got years and years and years of conversations and resources and everything else.

433
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:06,000
We're going to stand up looped and if that gets shut down by Facebook and Zuckerberg, okay, we're not losing the history.

434
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I mean, again, these are real concerns because we did, you know, there were, there was, and there continue to be like, you can't, some medical equipment.

435
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
There's lots of limitations of what you can do in a space book world and they, they rightly control the sandbox.

436
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:26,000
But we had to be smart about how we played in the sandbox until Katie did the thing and made looped and that took off again.

437
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And then the impact they are, and again, freely other on time and sometimes, you know, into this day you see people are like, okay, I had enough money to step away for a little while.

438
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Most of the time they come back because of the, the reward and the enrichment and just just getting to see the ripple effect of this pay it forward mentality in this community is.

439
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It's the best example I've ever seen of a do good community and it's global and it impacts something, you know, it's changing, I mean literally changing lives and how people approach what they can do with their own lives, what they can do with their kids.

440
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:23,000
So night scout was this fantastic innovation that allowed us to finally project and display glucose readings, but the next generation of that was automated insulin delivery, which came ahead of its time with this community.

441
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And I know that you, you told me that your daughter did not want a to pump that first, right, any of those systems only worked with metronic but you were involved in kind of helping.

442
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Crack the code for on the pod to be able to be connected to loop.

443
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Tell us about that a little bit.

444
00:42:47,000 --> 00:43:02,000
So there was a community here, like the loop application and people on the end and the folks on that side and I know I'm forgetting names, but Pete to me is still connected to the loop piece and the apple iOS application.

445
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:09,000
But it only worked with metronic and so they had an AID ran on iOS device, great accessible common.

446
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:17,000
But it ran with an older generation of metronic pumps that were somewhat hard to find.

447
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,000
It worked because they were inherently insecure to transmission.

448
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And I say inherently insecure meaning that they could be cracked and been wasted over I think literally thousands of hours.

449
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So when I say insecure, I mean it's like, yeah, it's secure in the same way that you can crack a bank vault if you've got all the time in the world and you have the patience.

450
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Then has the patience and that diligence.

451
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
But it worked in a metronic world and we're from older devices. They were hard, they were expensive.

452
00:43:51,000 --> 00:44:04,000
There was this weirdly stupidly expensive gray market of these devices that people were like, oh, now this piece of junk I've got in the drawers were something and there was a gross.

453
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I still think there was this gross abuse of this community once people figured out, oh.

454
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
That piece of junk in my drawers were 250 dollars. I'm going to go.

455
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Yeah.

456
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Yeah.

457
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And then there were people like my kid, you know, Carson was like, no, I'm not wearing tubes. Simple as that.

458
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
You know, she was heavily into dance.

459
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Wasn't going to do the things that really tubeed pump required from a lifestyle change.

460
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,000
So figured out that, okay, there is a massive community. There is a massive demand.

461
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
There's a big part continues to have this growing market share.

462
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And I think, you know, just and I don't remember who I was talking to.

463
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
But it was probably a late night and there were probably drinks involved.

464
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
But I was like, this is dump.

465
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
We should be able to figure out how to make this work on an omnipotent.

466
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
If Ben could figure out metronic, surely we can get there.

467
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And whether it was a wager or whatever, I was like, you know what?

468
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I'm going to, a thousand bucks as we can figure this out.

469
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And it was like, hang on.

470
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
There's lots of technology problems have been solved with bounties, right?

471
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
People have been doing that in this heck world for a long time.

472
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And so I emailed probably about 25 people and said, hey, I'm going to do this thing.

473
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
This is not the nice cut foundation because we are playing well into.

474
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I mean, literally we're trying to crack a device, right?

475
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
So we're, we're, we're attacking a device at this point.

476
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I said, I'm not doing this through the nonprofit.

477
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
This is, you know, this is personal out of pocket money.

478
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
But I want this.

479
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And I think we can do this will you commit and pledge with me.

480
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
You know, I was like, don't send me a check.

481
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I don't how long this is going to take.

482
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
But handshake deal.

483
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Let's put this puck together.

484
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And put up a, you know, a one page website, hey,

485
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
this is what we're going to do.

486
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
This is what the bounties were.

487
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm staying in, you know, again, I think I, I stayed for 1,000 bucks out of mine.

488
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
My, my wife is like, what are you doing?

489
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
You have to pay it out.

490
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I was like, I'll pay it.

491
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And I'll smile about it.

492
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
And I will.

493
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I mean, you know, for what you get back like.

494
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Yeah.

495
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Right.

496
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
But it's.

497
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And so we put this out there.

498
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
We talked about it.

499
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And we, I think at the end of the day,

500
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
we had someone in the ballpark of $45,000 in pledges.

501
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
For whoever figures this out and gets a working prototype.

502
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Everybody took off.

503
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Yes.

504
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
We're going to free this out.

505
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And then, you know, and I, I, I share the link with you.

506
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I think, again, peeps.

507
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Well, we have probably that's right up with all the technical details.

508
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And he's come on the show to share his story of the, everything in the Riley link and everything.

509
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Yeah.

510
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Yeah.

511
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I mean, so much he was doing the writing.

512
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Like he understood the radio part.

513
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
And so he was like, okay, I get it once we can figure out what the,

514
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
communication with a pod looks like.

515
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I can send the chat.

516
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
But we had to figure out how to talk to a pod.

517
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And that is a, again, you know, I hope you'll share the link for anybody who's really interested.

518
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
But it involved.

519
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Sure.

520
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Electron microscopes and involved.

521
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I believe the Royal College outside of London.

522
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
It involved in the A's.

523
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
It involved a retired programmer from California.

524
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Who's passion is reverse engineering, old electronics equipment.

525
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And sniffing out how those things talk and work.

526
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
He actually, I believe volunteers are the docent as like the California computer museum.

527
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,000
All of these random connections and people who are like, you know, we're not really part of the diabetes world.

528
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But this sounds like a fun challenge and let's break in.

529
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
And so we did and Thanksgiving 2018.

530
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
People had been testing off and on and I actually, again,

531
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Katie D. Simone had figured out some of the antenna problems.

532
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,000
The, the, the length of the antenna that was in the original Riley was such,

533
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
and this is not a radio expert.

534
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So forgive me if I get this wrong.

535
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
The length of the antenna.

536
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And I think it's not a fire in the original Riley did not create a really good connection to omnipods.

537
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And so we were going through omnipot failures like mad.

538
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Because when that communication failed, it not only didn't send a message,

539
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
but the pot itself would say something's gone wrong and blow itself up.

540
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
You know, omnipot users will know you basically create screamers.

541
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And oh yeah, I know a screamer.

542
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And so you, we were going through these things at a insane rate.

543
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
And again, Katie.

544
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Pete and figured it out.

545
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Katie started doing the hardware piece all came together.

546
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I put it on Carson in in Thanksgiving of 2018.

547
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And we immediately did the smartest thing we could do,

548
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
which was packed everybody on a car drive to another city.

549
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And he's all the worst holiday food you could think of including pizza and all the other things.

550
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I mean, I started my whole journey started with the Riley link.

551
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Well, like my first pump ever was the omnipod arrows six months after I was diagnosed.

552
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
And after a month, I got right on to loop.

553
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
And I had to carry around this Riley link.

554
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Right little orange air pods, pro case size.

555
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
And I always had to carry that around in order for my devices to talk to my phone.

556
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,000
And I believe it was I don't know, maybe two and a half, three years ago,

557
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
that they cracked it so that you didn't need to Riley link anymore.

558
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
And that they were able to speak directly to an omnipod dash.

559
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
You know, my hopes are that omnipod dash will be around forever,

560
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
but the case is it won't.

561
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
It will one day go away.

562
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And I hope hopefully not anytime soon, because I personally and many other people can't afford that to happen.

563
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
But, you know, then the next case would be like,

564
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
all right, well, how do we get these omnipod fives to communicate?

565
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Because they're built differently.

566
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
So that I don't want to think about that though.

567
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,000
No, and that's, that's also one of the inherent things that keep this process.

568
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Keep this project.

569
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Moving is that what we get released in the US is different from what's released in Canada

570
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
is different from what's released in Romania or Australia or Brazil.

571
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,000
The night scout Brazil group for a long time was massive and active.

572
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Because the access to the equipment was different,

573
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,000
and they weren't getting share and some of these other in remote monitoring options.

574
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And so what does it look like in the future?

575
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I don't know, maybe you know, maybe you'll be buying black market omnipod vives from,

576
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
you know, pick your country.

577
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Yeah.

578
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Well, and what you're saying, that's another reason why it is so important that night scout foundation

579
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
and all of these DIY abilities are available

580
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,000
because other people aren't always getting access to the devices we have here in the US.

581
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:13,000
So by creating these back doors to access a multitude of devices to get the best out there.

582
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
That opens access to everyone around the world.

583
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And there are even devices like the meow meow, which is this device they're using all over India

584
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:28,000
and Latin America and beyond where you put like you put it on top of a libre one.

585
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And it's constantly scanning it and sending it to your phone.

586
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
So you don't have to scan it yourself and allowing for automated insulin.

587
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Like, unfortunately, we have all in our own ways had to not wait and do it ourselves

588
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,000
because companies don't always have the incentive to bring the latest and greatest.

589
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
They don't have the incentive to bring the latest and greatest to everyone.

590
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:03,000
So people like you and everyone else involved are able to create these systems that are open source that people could say,

591
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Oh, well, you know, why don't I look at the tech that's available where I live.

592
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
How can I implement these open source platforms on a device like the Libre one?

593
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
And now that's being used for automated insulin.

594
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So this work goes so far beyond the work that's already been done on the device.

595
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
And using it with the latest G7 and nominee pod dash, which is what I'm doing.

596
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Like this is going, these software is being used in so many different ways.

597
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
It is.

598
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And I can't foresee any future where it isn't.

599
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Like you said, the state of healthcare throughout the world is dramatically different.

600
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:54,000
You know, I know there are devices in the EU, you know, some of the smaller pod style, right, the tubeless style.

601
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
There are other devices out there that are doing really cool things have good form factors.

602
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
And while we have a pod, you know, I won't say that I haven't looked at them.

603
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
That's kind of cool. That's kind of small.

604
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:13,000
You know, there's just going to be technology in different regulations and allow things to be put in different places.

605
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Above and beyond the financial incentives.

606
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And then I think, again, we talked a little bit about the personal choice and data and who controls that.

607
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
There will also be a need for people who want to dial this in.

608
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
You know, I am a massive fan of the of the work that beta has done.

609
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:39,000
And you know, having, you know, when everybody, you know, years ago thought was going to be the magical insulin,

610
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:46,000
AID device with with the isolate, you know, act, we, we bought into his the stock program again.

611
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
We tried to, okay, we want this, we want this to happen.

612
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:55,000
But because he's trying to satisfy a market demand, because he's trying to get through the FDA regulations, right?

613
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
The, the guardrails in the use case have to be both broad and narrow.

614
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Yeah, it's, it's got to be, the guardrails have to be really broad.

615
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
You're going to give this out through the county health provider.

616
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
You're going to give this out through various insurance providers.

617
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
You've got to make it as idiot proof as possible.

618
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I think there will always be a market and a demand for these devices that allow you to DIY dial in.

619
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Really manage your data and your insulin and everything else about it for you.

620
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:33,000
And there will always be a market for, hey, we just want to make this better for people who are tired of thinking about it 24 hours a day.

621
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Well, the, the night scout foundation just turned 10 years old.

622
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
That's amazing.

623
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Why did you start the foundation?

624
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
What was kind of the, the reasoning behind that?

625
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Um, really we talked about three things when we, when we started growing this thing up, right?

626
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
And there were, there were legitimately good concerns.

627
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Are we going to be individually named for contributing to this work, being involved in this work?

628
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I mean, I'm putting things on YouTube telling people how to hack into their DexCon device.

629
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And I use the word hack there pretty, pretty loosely.

630
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I don't think we really did much hacking on that side.

631
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
But there was some, there were some legal concerns.

632
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:21,000
There was also this idea of people who, who had made progress.

633
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Had gotten this thing up and running.

634
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
And we're like, hey, how can we help?

635
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
We're not programmers.

636
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
We're not developers.

637
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
We're parents.

638
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
We're, whatever.

639
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
We're part of this community.

640
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
But we want to be able to give back.

641
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
And so we're like, well, how do you take, you know, a 50 dollar donation and spread it out amongst 72 people?

642
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
That doesn't, that doesn't make a lot of sense.

643
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Um, you know, a tip jar.

644
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
How do you do a tip jar for a community?

645
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Doesn't work there.

646
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Um, and then some of the things that we were looking at even back then,

647
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
we were starting to run into one offer from the community.

648
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
You know, pebble.

649
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Hey, we want to,

650
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,000
a range and work with you guys for a discount on our watches because we think what you're doing is really cool.

651
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
But it would be really great if you had like a legal entity that we could write this off to.

652
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Okay, sure, interesting.

653
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Uh, the same problem.

654
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Anytime we looked at something like Microsoft Azure or even now, now people use AWS.

655
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Any of these massive systems that we wanted to leverage and go, hey, these are low cost, but they're not no cost.

656
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Can we figure out where to get that donated to the community?

657
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Every one of those companies like, hey, this is great.

658
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
We think this is really cool, but we don't donate to seven people on the internet.

659
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
That's not how this works.

660
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Yeah.

661
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Um, and so I started looking around and again, I was, I was not really on the development side and I started,

662
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
but I was talking with Jason and Ben and Lionel.

663
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
It's like, hey, we should do something about this and they were like,

664
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Yeah, that sounds really interesting, but let me get out this next bug fix because that's important and that's now.

665
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And I was like, okay, that's not where I can contribute, but I can fill up paperwork.

666
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
And I can make phone calls and I have a friend who runs a nonprofit that I can ask.

667
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,000
And I emailed, you know, the original board of directors and said, hey, I'm going to submit this paperwork.

668
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
And right now I'm planning to put your name on it unless you object.

669
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
And a few people did like, hey, I've got connections in this world.

670
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
You know, I don't want to be straddling the fence.

671
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I need to put some, you know, an air gap between me and this work.

672
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
But, but by and large everybody's like, yeah, that, that work.

673
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:33,000
You know, we sent people, we had people, hey, I've got this thing I want to see at the ATDD conference in Amsterdam.

674
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Can you help subsidize?

675
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
And so when we put those sorts of things together now, it's really people like, hey, I've got this idea.

676
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
There's something I want to see, there's something I want to contribute.

677
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I want to improve whatever kind of foundation help me out.

678
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
And we have a conversation behind the scenes.

679
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
And we honestly, we look at what people have brought to the table, right?

680
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
These are not.

681
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,000
You can't message me out of the blue and say, hey, can I get five grand to go to a conference in Amsterdam?

682
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
No.

683
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:08,000
But you've been involved with this community for work and have a track record of helping.

684
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
And you need some portion of that to cover hotels or to cover training.

685
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Whatever that we can do, right?

686
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Nobody is, nobody is getting a free trip to Amsterdam.

687
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I had some people ask this, you know, Theresa, we helped with that.

688
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
We helped some of the developers like Tim and things that we like, yeah, we'll cover an Airbnb for work.

689
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
You know, five people sharing an Airbnb, that doesn't feel luxurious to be.

690
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Yeah.

691
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
It gave them the ability to get there.

692
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:45,000
And they were able to all meet up at ATTD and share information and continue this legacy that is so important.

693
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
And so it's, you know, it's great that you're still supporting people like that to be able to.

694
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Go and give, give these ideas to everyone and share and build, you know.

695
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
To me now the foundation is enablement.

696
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Can we enable the next idea, the next breakthrough, the next conversation?

697
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And so anytime somebody comes to us with those sorts of things and it's like, yeah, that sounds interesting or that sounds.

698
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Yes.

699
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:19,000
And so, you know, I would absolutely encourage if you've got something you've been part of this community or you want to go and visit.

700
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
You know, I know Amy's doing this stuff in Chicago this summer.

701
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:28,000
You're in that neighborhood and you want to learn more because you've got a great idea, reach out to us.

702
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And let's see how we can get you access to deliver on your great ideas to help this community.

703
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Yeah, I will actually be at that D data at ADA in June in Chicago.

704
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
That's run by Amy and Amy was just on the show a few weeks ago.

705
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:57,000
So it's so cool to hear all these different sides and perspectives from these early days where she was out reporting on all the tech and asking for more than you had people like you.

706
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:05,000
That were deep in getting this stuff to work and helping people get on it.

707
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
And then Pete coming on the show that talking about all the tech behind it.

708
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:16,000
So I'm kind of building this whole catalog of what's going on and what happened in the DIY space.

709
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I'm also talking about stuff now like trio and loop.

710
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,000
But there's such an incredible story that happened here and we're getting a taste of it today.

711
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And I encourage everyone to go listen to those other episodes too to hear more.

712
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Just this this community.

713
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
It's, you know, the people you've talked to.

714
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I'm always like I'm flattered and a little embarrassed to be listed with them.

715
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
But, you know, it isn't an amazing group of folks.

716
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:53,000
So, you know, yeah, if you're listening to this by all means, please go listen to what Amy and Pete and some of these other folks have have brought to this table because it's.

717
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
It's, it's nothing, it's nothing sort of heroic.

718
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Well, James, thank you so much for coming on the show.

719
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:09,000
This was so fascinating to hear and I'm glad that we got to hear your side of the story and and everyone can go and listen to those other episodes and get the other side of the story in the show notes.

720
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:18,000
And yeah, I hope that people can hear this and also if they have something that they're working on and they want to, you know.

721
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Get the word out or get involved in some way.

722
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:30,000
How can they reach out to the night scout foundation and kind of in, you know, see what you can do together, I guess.

723
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Yeah, I think probably the easiest night south night scout foundation.org.

724
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And on that, there is an option for basically soliciting for support.

725
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
And it's a little short form. Hey, who are you?

726
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
What do you want to do and do you have a ballpark cost?

727
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Well, James, thank you so much and I'm, I'm hopeful that some people reach out to you with their, their ideas.

728
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I appreciate it. Justin, thanks for the advice. Good catching up.

729
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
What do you think of this story? What do you think of the we are not waiting community?

730
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Let me know in the comments on YouTube and listen to those other episodes to get a taste of all of the different sides of these, this, this community that has worked so hard to make technology as good as it is today.

731
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I want to produce maybe a five part documentary series 15 minute episode that get into all of these areas of this community.

732
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
What do you watch that? Do you want to hear it?

733
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000

I would love to do this. I think it would need a large budget.

735
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Maybe the night scout foundation wants to to fund it.

736
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And perhaps we crowdfund from all of you so we can make this happen.

01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I want it to be good. I want it to be even better than the community united documentary we did on the LA fires, which I'll also throw in the show notes because it's just a great piece that we did.

738
01:02:52,000 --> 01:03:01,000
And yeah, I think that this story and all the facets of it and all the people deserve recognition and I'd love to put it down in like a multi part series.

01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
So let me know if you want to see it in the comments. I'm Justin and I'll see you next week.
