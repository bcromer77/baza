These are my go-to diabetes pick-up lines with my wingman, Omnipod.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,960
You can touch my pod any day. Super secure. Just like you.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,040
Yeah, you can get a wet. In fact, it's waterproof up to 25 feet for 60 minutes.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,480
Let's get deep. I may lose myself later, but even when all of the clothes come off,

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,400
I will still have my automated insulin delivery right here. You are a complete snack.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,520
I can eat you up all day. On the best part about this snack, I don't have to bowl this.

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,400
All I have on is my pod. I'm happy to have you on me too.
