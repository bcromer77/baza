I just got the tandem movie tube pump and I'm going to be unboxing all of the supplies and accessories that come with it in order to use it.

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:18,080
So here's what the pump looks like. It's super duper small and you've got the little charging pad that goes down and you put the pump on it,

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:26,960
a cable to connect it to the wall. Now let's look in the accessories pack. There is an AC adapter for the wall,

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:33,440
and then you've got a clip that you can, you know, clip it onto your belt or wherever you want.

5
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:41,520
The starter kit comes with two of the adhesive sleeves. It's kind of big, especially when you compare it to Omni pod.

6
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:49,200
So the way this works is you'd put the pump inside this little sleeve, slide it in and then there you go.

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,560
It looks a little medical more so I think than Omni pod. Let me know what you think in the comments.

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:02,480
Now let's see what the cartridge looks like. The cartridge goes on top and then that's what the infusion set clicks into.

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,600
There is like a whole plunger system in order to put the insulin in. Let's look at the infusion sets.

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,880
And I got both the short and the long infusion set. So the short one is only five inches. So this is the infusion set. It's super short.

11
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,440
You basically pull it out, put it down, pinch it together, and then it puts it on.

12
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,360
This is going to be a new experience trying on tubes. Let me know what you think.

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:32,320
Whether you like tube or tubeless in the comments. And let me know if you have any questions about Tanda Mobie as I reviewed.

14
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,720
I'll be putting content all across my YouTube channel, my blog, and my podcast.

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,479
