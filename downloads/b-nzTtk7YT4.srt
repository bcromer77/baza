00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,160
Howdy. Today we are playing some V-R.

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,080
He's gonna be fun. We are playing raw data, which is this first person shooter. It is multi-player.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,120
So we are going to be playing together.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,680
Look down. Look your left waist. Left side of your waist. And then we'll pick up your bone.

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,880
I mean, hold it. And then you can't let go.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,640
Yeah, you literally go get it. You'll get it. Hold a little string part.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,280
And then pull it back and let go.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,640
Oh my god, the...

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,280
You're gonna do your good. Just lightly put your figure on your seat and then press it.
