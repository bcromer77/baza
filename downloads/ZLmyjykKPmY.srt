So, Philips you just announced their Philips Hue Syncbox and I got to get a first look at how it worked

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,600
completely transforming your entertainment system with their beautiful lighting. Let's check it out.

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,600
A few months ago, I checked out the Philips Hue Sync on PC and was amazed at how immersive gaming music and video playback was

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,440
using the software with Philips Hue lights. I asked about the possibility of this technology coming to our entertainment system

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,520
and they couldn't tell me anything. Until now, meet the Philips Hue play HDMI Syncbox.

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,520
It may be a lot of words but it does one epic thing. It syncs your lights with your entertainment system.

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,360
I got to demo it to the Avengers trailer and I have to say I was impressed. I had a

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,400
grain on my face the entire time I watched it because it looked that good. I was surprised by how

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,760
comfortable and in sync it felt and how smoothly it transitioned. Now here's a bit about the device.

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,760
You can connect up to 4 HDMI devices to the box, watch any content and the box will create the surround

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,840
sound of lighting. It will also automatically switch between the devices depending on which one is being used

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,360
which helps for seamless switching. You can link up to 10 color capable Philips Hue lights through the app

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,680
and it works with all of your current bulbs. The lights they used in the demo were awesome so I

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,479
threw links in the description below. They also added a couple slots in the power cord to connect

15
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,520
lights near the TV so you can save on an outlet space. This is a nice little touch and you can tell

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,960
how much thought they put it into it. The Hue Syncbox will release on October 15th and you can pre-order it

17
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,400
now on the Philips Hue website. I've put a link in the description. So that is a little tease at the Philips

18
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,800
Hue Syncbox. I will have one soon in my home and I'm going to be playing with it even more and making

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,080

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,360
Wow. Are you recording? Yes. Okay.
