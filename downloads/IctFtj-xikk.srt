Welcome to this Justin Tech. I'm Justin and I'm going to tell you all about tech. Today

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,960
we're going to talk about Hugh and Lifex to the most popular colorful bulbs for the smart

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,760
home. They are direct competitors and they just came out with their brand new bulbs. The

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,840
Hugh is a lot sleeker looking. It's also lighter. The Lifex happens to be bulkier. The Hugh

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,240
needs a bridge to connect the lights to your internet. The Lifex they are their own Wi-Fi light bulbs.

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:41,360
No bridge necessary. The Lifex is the bridge. Lifex has 1,000 lumens and the Hugh has 800 lumens.

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,320
They both function completely different. Their apps are completely different. The Lifex app

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,320
is extremely intuitive. It's beautiful. It's just so easy to use. So simple and I love that

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,560
simplistic aspect of it. Whereas the Hugh, it's a little clunky. It's very listy. The number one

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,960
thing that I like with Lifex is the color wheel. So easy to use. They're so much flexibility with it.

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,360
Not only can you change the color but you can also change the brightness with this little scroll. On the

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,320
Hugh they have an actual Hugh. You try to go to different areas and you're thumb gets stuck on the edge.

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,640
You can't get exactly where you want or you're trying to move one light bulb and then it gets

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,080
included with all the other light bulbs and you're just not happy. For those of you

15
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,960
have an iPhone, you're in luck with Hugh because HomeKit is available which allows you to speak to

16
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,560
Siri and turn your lights on and off, dim them, change colors. Not available on Lifex yet but they have

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,760
announced that it will be available this year. But Lifex has Microsoft's capabilities with Cortana.

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,200
There's also a Windows app that runs on Windows 10 so you can be on your PC, your Surface Book,

19
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,640
awesome. When using these light bulbs side by side, you can see a complete difference between

20
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,600
the two. So now I'm going to use an app that allows me to control both life bulbs and make them the

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,480
same color. First I'm going to take them to green and as you can see Hugh just doesn't make the green

22
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,320
I'm looking for and then I'll take them to yellow and Hugh like barely change. Lifex there's a distinct

23
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,320
difference between the two colors and when I take it to sign on Lifex is that color Hugh just makes

24
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:25,040
like a white. Now when I take it to a purple you can't see it on screen that well but Lifex is purple and

25
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,959
Hugh is way more blue and Lifex is white brighter. When I take it to the pink they both look similar but

26
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,079
still Lifex is way stronger and I could always dim it to make it match the Hugh and then when I take to

27
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:42,640
this red Lifex again is Way stronger and Hugh just doesn't compare and brightness. On top of all that

28
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,920
the Lifex is said to have 36,000 hours of life and the Hugh only has 15,000 hours of life.

29
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,440
The light bulbs are the same price but to get started with Hugh you need that bridge and 60 dollar

30
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,120
bridge. So you can get the starter kit for 200 bucks comes with three bulbs and a bridge or

31
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,640
you can get a bridge for 60 bucks in a life for 60 bucks. So that means you have to spend $120 to get

32
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,200
into the Hugh colored life bulb world. With lifex like I said earlier no bridge necessarily the

33
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,040
life bulb is the bridge it's 60 bucks done. After playing around with both bulbs for a week playing around

34
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,320
with their apps the colors I have to say that lifex is a winner for me. Both bulbs claim to produce

35
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,560
16 million colors but it's pretty obvious watching them side by side that Hugh just doesn't perform.

36
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,280
It really should be called lack of Hugh. They should only say they produce 10 million colors. Lifex is

37
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,800
creating awesome environments at my home. You can create all these different colors Hugh can't.

38
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,000
Hugh does have their huge family Philips behind them with the whole line of products. I would go with the

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,920
lifex bulbs for your normal bulbs that you want to make colors with but if you want the light strips the

40
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,800
Hugh go the bloom then I would have those around get a Logitech Harmony remote that can control all of it

41
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,280
and good to go. While I hope this comparison video has cleared up some questions about both of these

42
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:18,480
bulbs like I said lifex is for me but maybe not for Hugh. This is Justin Tech. See you later.
