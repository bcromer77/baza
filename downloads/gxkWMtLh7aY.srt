00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Today I'm at AT&T in Westwood, checking out the Magic Leap 1 Creator Edition.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,840
This device isn't necessarily VR or AR, it's a spatial computing device, it analyzes

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,880
your surroundings and sends light to your eyes, creating three-dimensional objects around you.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,280
In my last video, I played Game of Thrones, The Dead Mustie Experience, and it was really

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,280
cool.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,280
There's a white walker.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,280
Yeah!

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,280
Holy sh, oh he just died.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,280
I killed him.

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,720
Got with Tim Johnson, VP of sales for Magic Leap, and he told me all about the device

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,840
and let me play a bunch of games.

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,440
Your retina is the screen.

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,440
So when people say, oh, what's the resolution?

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,680
There's no pixels here, so I can't really talk about resolution.

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,120
Your retina is basically seeing the information, so just like you absorb light from the

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,960
room, we're sending light to your eye, and then you're seeing the three-dimensional objects

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960
in space.

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,720
There are four world cameras, basically, or recording everything you see.

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,600
There are depth sensors and all kinds of other sensors that are basically making sure that they

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,040
can measure the space and know how you're moving through it.

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,760
There are two eye tracking cameras that are basically watching what you're looking at.

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,920
Obviously, with your eyes, you can also get biomarkers, so obviously, long-term, you wouldn't

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,640
log into this, you'd put it on, it would recognize that it was you, and then it would work.

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,480
Otherwise, it wouldn't work for anybody else, if that's what you decided.

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,480
We can tell a lot about your health, your heart rate, your cholesterol levels, all of those

26
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,600
kinds of things we can tell from your eye, so it's pretty amazing what it can do.

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,800
This is the first of its kind, sixth degree of freedom, control.

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:37,080
We can tell what position you have it in space, so you can obviously move it very freely, and basically

29
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,040
you can tell where it is in relation to you, and where it is in relation to the content.

30
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:48,400
Gesture, obviously, just like HoloLens, voice, eye tracking, head pose, even, so if you're

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,320
holding your face in a certain way, you can actually tell whether you're questioning something,

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,600
so as the AI gets to know you over time, we'll know what you're responding positively to,

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,960
which you're responding negatively to, and the core apps, we've got Helio, which is a volumetric

34
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:08,120
web browser, so one of the apps that you can see on here is WayFair, which you can shop for furniture,

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,360
you can pull the pieces of furniture out of the website, put them into your room, and again,

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,040
because we know the size of your room, and we know the dimensions of that chair, it's the

37
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,080
right size when it's put into your room, you can change the pattern, all that kind of stuff.

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,800
Also, shopping will be a lot different in the future than the social, which you can chat with

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,400
other people in kind of an avatar state, more like a Jedi Council, and then yeah, HoloLens, yeah, definitely

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
thank you.

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,720
Tim gave me his personal headsets to try out.

42
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,400
First I played Angry Birds, first person's sling shot.

43
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,480
It was fascinating to see how far this game has come since it's original release.

44
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,280
I remember the first time I tried out Angry Birds, and it was so dictating, is on my iPhone

45
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,720
4, and now I'm trying Angry Birds out for the first time, and augmented reality.

46
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
This is amazing.

47
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,680
Okay, so we've got a bunch of pigs, we've got a TNT on top, I'm going to pull this back, I'm going

48
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
to do this hard.

49
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,680
Here we go.

50
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,160
Boom, I've also played the Angry Birds game, Isle of Pigs, on the Oculus Quest, which is a pretty

51
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,200
similar feel, and it's a fun, quick, and easy game to pick up and play.

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,840
I highly recommend it.

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
See three peos here.

54
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,560
Next, I played Star Wars Project Porg.

55
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll em x-lab, I know them, I just tried out the void.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,400
Side note, a couple months ago I tried out this awesome Star Wars VR experience, you should

57
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,640
check out the video.

58
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,160
Now back to Porg's.

59
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,960
This game was basically Tomagaji meet Star Wars, these cute little Porg's were running all around,

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,320
and I was feeding them.

61
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,960
There's Porg's, there you go, it was adorable.

62
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,120
After the games, I checked out the gallery, which showed up some cool features.

63
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,080
Right now I have this deer that I just placed right on that shelf.

64
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:50,440
Wow, there it is, my horse video is on my wall, and I can look away, do my thing, and then

65
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,800
if I want to just see beautiful horses on the countryside, there they are.

66
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,320
I love it.

67
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,520
I was also lucky enough to check out the magic leap at 18T shape a few weeks ago, and played

68
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,120
one of the best games on the device, and one of the hardest names to pronounce.

69
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,080
Dr. Gordbord's invaders.

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,200
Basically I was fighting off hordes of robots that were entering from a hole in the wall.

71
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,960
This game was extremely impressive, and it's the number one game you have to try at 18T.

72
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:25,320
Wow, that was probably the coolest AR experience that I've ever witnessed, move over HoloLens.

73
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,840
So the magic leap creator edition is a really cool headset, and unlike any I have ever tried.

74
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,520
But there is no way I would buy it for $2300.

75
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,280
I do recommend heading to 18T and checking this thing out, but I don't think I recommend anyone

76
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,120
to buy it unless you're filthy rich or an early adopter.

77
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,520
Alright, well the battery died, I was playing too much.

78
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,520
Wow guys, that was incredible.

79
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,200
I want one of these, can you get me $2300 please?

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,600
I've got to say I'm thoroughly impressed, come to your local AT&T store, you can must do it.

81
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,000
It's in these five cities right here, you definitely have to check it out, they're going to be rolling

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,720
it out to more AT&T stores throughout 2019, so if it's not by you right now, it will be coming soon.

83
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,800
I've gotten an awesome VR video coming out on Thursday and a giveaway, so make sure

84
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,760
to subscribe and click the bell to get notifications.

85
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,720
That's all I've got for you guys, I'm Justin, I'll take you later.
