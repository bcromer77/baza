00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Hey guys, welcome back to my channel. I'm so excited to show off this brand new product.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,160
It is the Phillips U smart plug. What's so great about this smart plug is that it actually has

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,880
Bluetooth. So you don't need a smart bridge in order to use this thing. You really could just have this

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,040
and use your phone with the Bluetooth Phillips U app, which is a separate app from the Phillips U app.

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,680
So again, you do not need a bridge, but if you have one, that's great. I've been wanting a

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,920
smart plug for a long time from Phillips U so that I can mix it into my Phillips U ecosystem that I already

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,920
have with my lights. It just makes it easier now to control all of my lighting, including the

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,120
lights that can't take bulbs. For example, how am I going to use this with that smiley face back there,

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,239
that neon sign. Funny story. I actually got that sign when I went to the museum of neon art with a

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,480
bunch of my friends. We were so excited if we drove an hour we get there and the museum was closed. So

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:04,879
we walked around the gift shop for two hours and I was so severely under the influence of art that I bought

12
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,240
that for $400. Did I regret it? Maybe a teeny bit, but you know what? Now I don't because that's my

13
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:17,280
face truly represents who I am. I'm pretty happy guy. What can I say? Anyway, back to the smart plug,

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:31,759
right? Let's do this. Now it's plugged in and how do we get it to work? Well, I've got an app for you. Yes,

15
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:38,320
the Phillips U app. Let's open it up. I'm going to open up the Phillips U Bluetooth app. There it is right there.

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:45,840
And I'm going to set things lights and I'm going to click that plus sign, right? So it's now searching

17
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,880
for lights. There we go. So it says Hugh Lamp. No, that's not the one I want. How to connect your lights. No,

18
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,160
I don't want the Hugh Lamp. Okay, smart plug. Remove the smart plug from the wall socket. Then plug it back in.

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,600
Make sure you are within three feet of the smart plug. Okay. Well, this isn't working out as planned.

20
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,880
There it is. Hugh plug, got it. See, you just got to adapt in this business, adapt in it,

21
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,520
and it works out easily. Okay, Hugh plug. So you're going to click that and I'm going to call it

22
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:30,000
smile because it's what it is. And I believe that's it. Let's see how this works. So I'm going to go to my

23
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:39,600
lights and cross my fingers. I'm going to click smile. It works. Yeah, smile.

24
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,640
So now if I wanted to, I could connect this also, which I will to my Phillips U ecosystem on the Phillips

25
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,560
U app. But I just wanted to show that to you guys so that you know that the Bluetooth one works really well.

26
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,160
You can also go a step further if you have a Google Nest or an Alexa. You can use those to control

27
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,960
these lights and plugs as well. So definitely do that if you have those. I know I will. So that's all I have for the

28
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,080
Phillips U smart plug. I'm really excited about it. Thank you Phillips for creating it for us. Also,

29
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,560
really exciting is that Phillips U and I have actually teamed up so we're going to be doing a giveaway for one of these.

30
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,360
So to find out the rules for that, go ahead over to my Instagram. And you know what, I have a lot of

31
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,160
filled two videos coming out. So you should subscribe to this channel and click that bell for alerts.

32
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Anyway, that's all I've got for you guys today. I'm Justin, and I'll take you later.

33
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,160
Hmm. It's so good. Nice, so good.
