1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Sernova is one of the many companies working on a cure for type 1 diabetes.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:11,520
Its unique approach in plants insulin producing cells into a bio-engineered cell pouch,

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,520
and in early studies, has helped some people with diabetes achieve full insulin independence

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,880
for years.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,520
But with challenges like immunosuppressants and scaling the technology for widespread use,

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,600
there's still a long road ahead.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,640
Welcome to the show, I'm Justin, I have Type 1 Diabetes and I hope for it to be cured one day.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,080
On here I talk off things diabetes tech news and management.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:43,400
Last week we did an entire episode on the landscape of the cure research going into a cure for Type 1 Diabetes.

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,320
Today we've got fellow T1D and the CEO of Sernova, Jonathan Rigby.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,040
He's joining me to share his personal journey in the diabetes and cure space.

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:00,920
Why this mission is so close to his heart and how Sernova's decade-long pursuit of a cure is evolving.

13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:07,160
We get into the technology behind its cell pouch, the clinical trials that have already changed lives,

14
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:15,000
and the exciting next steps, including advances in stem cell derived isles and gene edited cells that could

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,440
eventually eliminate the need for immunosuppressants.

16
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,960
Keep in mind that anything here on the show is for educational purposes only, it is not medical advice,

17
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,040
always consult with a physician before making changes to your health care.

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,160
Now for the conversation.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,960
Jonathan, welcome to the show, it's so great to have you on.

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,640
Thank you for having me, Justin, it's great to see you.

21
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,200
Of course, yeah, I've heard a lot about your research, your studies, your approach.

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,960
In fact, I had someone on the show who was kind of giving me the landscape of cures,

23
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,800
but getting a deeper dive in what Sernova's doing is exciting and I can't wait for everyone to hear

24
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,440
what's going on, but before we dive into that, I want to understand how you got involved in all this.

25
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,840
What's your background? How did you get into research for a cure?

26
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:16,280
Oh my word, I miss being a long journey to be honest, Justin, so I grew up in the UK and I'm a biologist,

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:24,440
but when I was at the ripe old age of 18 years old, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.

28
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm highly sure that I was type 1 for many years before I was diagnosed, so I guess most of my life

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,960
I've been diabetic and so it's something very close to my heart and even close to my pancreas.

30
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:51,400
I've been working in the pharmaceutical biotech field for just over 30 years now and I started

31
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,120
my career with big pharmaceutical companies and I really enjoyed that and then I figured I

32
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:06,440
maybe better suited to smaller companies where my efforts could yield a meaningful impact because I

33
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:13,960
got a great deal of satisfaction from working with fantastic teams that get drug products approved

34
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,720
for serious medical diseases. So when I was in the UK we got a couple of products approved for

35
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:27,000
pulmonary arterial hypertension and for cystic fibrosis. But I had my very keen eye

36
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:35,480
open scanning the horizon in the San Francisco Bay area where I was fascinated by the entrepreneurial

37
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,960
spirit. The finance things that were going on a lot of these scientific developments and I

38
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:47,960
particularly had an interest in a company called Aradam Corporation that were developing

39
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:54,600
inhaled insulin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in collaboration with normal Nordisk.

40
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:03,800
And so a long story short I for the angle of myself a job and relocated the family from the UK to

41
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:11,240
California and that's where a lot of this began. How did you get involved with Sernova?

42
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:20,680
When did that start? Yeah okay so you know I moved out from Aradam and I co-founded my first

43
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:28,120
biotech company with a friend of the colleague called Sogenics. It was a CNS company and you know we

44
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:35,080
find us the company we grew the company we got a drug product approved and marketed for migraine

45
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,600
which is that company public and it went on to develop a drug for a rare disease called drove a syndrome

46
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,920
which is a terrible form of epileptic effects in children. So that that company was acquired

47
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,920
and then I went on to found a company called steady-med in the bay area to develop a drug product for pulmonary

48
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:04,040
arterial hypertension which with that company public and that company was also acquired. So in between

49
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:11,640
these things there were some pretty prestigious investors in New York and the Bay Area that invested

50
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:18,440
their capital into a company called Zeris Pharmaceuticals that at the time were developing the world's first

51
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:26,120
liquid-stable glucogon to treat severe hyperglycemia for type 1 diabetes and they asked me to

52
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,880
represent them on the board of Zeris which I was happy to do and then the company had a technical

53
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:38,200
setback and so they asked me to work on that and fix it and with again surrounded by a great team

54
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:46,760
we fixed the problem and that company went on to do a public offering as well and the product is approved

55
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:53,000
it sits on my bedside cabinet in the room behind me hoping that I never need to use it to

56
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,160
get a wife use it to get out of it to get out of it to be a happy glycemic. So I also on the board

57
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:09,160
of a company called IMtheraputix, they are developing a drug product to delay the onset of type 1 diabetes

58
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:16,840
I was on the board of a company called Thermaline that was developing a liquid a thermostable insulin

59
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:25,160
for countries that don't have called supply chain mechanism systems in place and then a few other

60
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:31,800
things but middle of last year I decided to look for something new and exciting to do

61
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,920
and a colleague of mine who I sit on a board with a cancer company board told me about Sermilva

62
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,160
frankly I haven't heard of the company but you know I started to look at the technology

63
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:54,840
this vision of developing a functional cure for type 1 diabetes and and I was sold you know I

64
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,440
looked at the data I looked at the technology and they asked me to join as a member of the board of

65
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:08,360
director's arranging to live last year and happily did so with the short period of time they asked me

66
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,240
to become the executive chairman and help capitalise the company so I said yes

67
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,160
that a little bit after that asked me to be the CEO and of course I joined

68
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,560
again because this is something very very personal for me and I believe in the future of the company

69
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:33,800
wow well thank you for telling me all of that because it's it's so interesting here people like

70
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:41,880
use your background and and all the work you've done in this field it it does sound personal to you and

71
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:48,680
it gives me hope every time I have someone like you on my show who lives with this disease

72
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:56,600
understands the struggle and genuinely wants to make it better in some way and to get to work on something

73
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:03,880
that can do that is is incredible so thank you for all the work you've done so far I'm I'm excited about

74
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:13,560
the work you're doing here and I think what that what someone like you also helps give me hope with

75
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:21,159
is you know so many people are jaded that there will ever be a cure you know people have been told for

76
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:27,000
years five to ten years there will be a cure and at this point people are over it they don't think it's

77
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:35,480
coming but when I hear about people who live with this disease working on that cure that gives me hope

78
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:41,080
because these people people like you want to see the cure because it will better your life too right that's a big

79
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,720
investment what are your thoughts on this fact that you know everyone's heard five to ten years there will

80
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,840
be a cure I mean have you been hearing that your whole life and do you think that we're actually at a

81
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:03,000
point where maybe that's true now just in first of all thank you for the thanks but I also thank

82
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,320
yourself for the great exposure of development stage technologies should products etc that you make

83
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:19,240
because that contribute significantly to the knowledge base of people in the field of diabetes

84
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,680
and for parents children caregivers who are frightened to death because of the disease that

85
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:31,160
their friends, their relatives, their husbands, wives, children have so a fact thanks to you and yes my father

86
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:39,160
ever since I became diabetic would send me newspaper articles you know three mice in the laboratory

87
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:47,800
and Liverpool hospital are no longer diabetic or you know there's a cure around the corner and I think back

88
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:57,160
to when you know literally a hundred years ago and before then diabetes was a death sentence

89
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:04,600
you were you are certain to die pretty darn quickly and I think of the scientists in Canada in London

90
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:12,920
Ontario and Toronto, Bunting and Baston and Colip you know they probably thought they could never do anything about this

91
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,839
but they did you know the breakthrough was made insulin was discovered it went sounds to be purified

92
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:29,079
and in fact when I was diagnosed I was injecting myself with porcelain insulin from a glass syringe

93
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:36,839
that was I would reuse over and over every single day terribly blunt and nasty thick needles

94
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:44,200
and no way to measure my blood sugar so you think about where we've come since then to where we are today

95
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:52,280
so now you know I'm the the benefactor of I use an insulin pump I use a continuous glucose meter

96
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:01,720
like a new you do and it's a it's a millennia of progress from where where I used to be and obviously

97
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:08,440
now we're injecting a recombinant human insulin which is very very similar to where we are now

98
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,960
to normal instant but we've got a long way to go and so I have absolutely no a day to my mind

99
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:22,840
that one day people will say do you remember that disease called diabetes you know it's it's gone

100
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:29,800
and there'll be a lot of people responsible for fixing this disease, curing this disease and

101
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:38,200
you know helping people live the lives of a daily basis yeah I really do hope for a day when we can say that

102
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,240
and I hope it's during my lifetime because I think that would just be so incredible to see

103
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,480
it would feel like a payoff I think to your work even to my work I think to so many people's work it would

104
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:55,800
feel really gratifying and then I guess just to be able to have my diabetes cared would be quite nice

105
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:04,200
this episode is sponsored by OmniPod as someone with T1D and with an incredibly active lifestyle it's

106
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,120
important for me not to get tied up especially with tubes on my insulin pump I love to go swimming,

107
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,800
lift weights and play kickball with friends and with OmniPod 5 I never have to worry about tubes

108
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,920
getting in the way plus not having to disconnect helps me to stay in range during all of my

109
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:26,120
favorite physical activities that includes sexy time too see if you're eligible for a 30 day

110
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,040
trial by visiting OmniPod.com slash dive tech on there you'll see full safety and risk information

111
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:40,520
and trial terms that's OmniPod.com slash dive tech let's get into Sernova tell us a little bit about

112
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:51,800
the company is the cure for diabetes what Sernova's always been focused on? Yes it has it's mainly focused

113
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:59,560
on type one diabetes we are doing some work in thyroid disease and hemophilia as well but the main focus is

114
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:12,280
always being type one diabetes the concept of replacing dysfunctional cells that are normal

115
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:19,080
pankers would have so the alpha cells are beta cells and the delta cells and so the company

116
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:27,800
going back in history developed what you can see here on the screen we call this our cell poached technology

117
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:37,160
and it literally is a poached and it's made from implantable, playable, surgical mesh so what

118
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:45,160
the physician does right now in our clinical trial is the physician will surgically implant this beneath

119
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:52,360
the skin of your abdomen but above the muscle fascia of your abdomen then what happens your blood vessels

120
00:13:52,360 --> 00:14:00,200
grow around this they grow in it and they grow through it and we call it a bio hybrid organ so it

121
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:08,040
literally turns into what we call a bio hybrid organ we can see these horizontal channels there are plastic

122
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:16,280
rods essentially so when this has become vascularized the surgeon will go into under your skin again

123
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:23,720
it will pull these rods out leaving these cylindrical cylinders inside the pouch into which

124
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:31,959
he will then now she will then impregnate this with functional eyelet cells and so that's the technology

125
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:40,520
and we've been working on this for several years now and we are partly through the phase one to clinical

126
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:46,840
trial which means your evaluating principle is safety and also you're looking for efficacy

127
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:55,880
and the efficacy that we've been looking for is patients becoming insulin independent and what that

128
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:02,439
means it means that you no longer have to rely on your insulin pump, on your auto injector, on your vials and so

129
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:09,240
inches and you can go back your daily life without that as you know is a burden of some

130
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:17,800
way of treating T one day at the moment and in the first call hot we are six patients and all of those

131
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:24,760
six patients achieved insulin independence for varying lengths of time I don't want to over promise

132
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,800
and over stay where we are you know we are still very much in the research and development stage

133
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:37,080
but we have more patients in the study now and then next year we'll be moving to a different kind of

134
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:43,160
cell cells that I'd be happy to talk to you about it. Yeah a few of the things that you've mentioned I want

135
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:51,480
to dig deeper into but before we do where did the idea for a cell pouch come from it it seems so different

136
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:58,200
and unique compared to a lot of the other research out there why was this approach important for

137
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:06,600
certain of it to to focus on. Yeah so the scientific founders of the organisation you know

138
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:15,000
understood the debut going to try and cure human diseases that are related to dysfunctional cells

139
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:24,520
you need to have a mechanism or vehicle into which you can put the cells that you take them from

140
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:31,800
external you put them inside and one of the things that they've used being critical was retrievability

141
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:41,400
so if you put the cells into an organ into a muscle just into your skin have an preventeness but

142
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:48,600
should there be a problem it's preferable to be able to remove them so the cell pouch does a few things it

143
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:57,000
allows this containment system that can be retrieved of necessary but it also turns into this

144
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,800
vascularised organ so these cells need to live then you do oxygen they need nutrients and if they are

145
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:11,480
in something that isn't porous and in contact with the circulatory system and the chance that they will die

146
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,640
so that's where the idea came from and that's what we're diligently working on today. When someone gets the

147
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,080
pouch inserted is it on the outside like is it something you can see through see and feel through the

148
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:33,480
skin or is it like behind the muscles is so you have your muscles then on top of that you have the skin

149
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:41,160
and there's kind of a gap between so it goes into that gap so it sits on top of the muscles but underneath

150
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:48,840
your skin which allows for this prolific vascularisation and when the patients have these

151
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:56,680
implanted they don't feel anything you can't see it you can't feel it and they they forget about it

152
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:05,240
okay I mean I'm just so if I was you know had a six pack I don't right now because I'm you know

153
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,320
I just haven't been on my routine I I've never had a six pack but I've been toned anyway

154
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:15,400
if and when I have a six pack if I had this I wouldn't be able to see it like it wouldn't be over my

155
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:23,800
abs if I like was that cut or what it I'm just curious. No you wouldn't be able to see it it's incredibly

156
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:31,080
thin and incredibly malleable and it literally gets surrounded by blood vessels so you you can't see it

157
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:39,000
I know that this approach requires immunosuppressants. Can you explain to us why they are needed in this approach

158
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:50,520
currently? Yes well it's an interesting question because you and I are diabetic because of our

159
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:56,600
immune system. Not a lot of people know that so your immune system is your best friend

160
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:03,480
where it's fighting off millions and millions of bacteria viruses and cancer cells every single day

161
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:11,160
but it can it can turn around and attack the body's own cells and there are lots of diseases

162
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,280
caused by the immune system we call them autoimmune diseases and type one diabetes is an autoimmune disease

163
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:26,840
so once upon a time the immune system decided to draw a destroyer pancreas and one day decided to

164
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:35,000
destroy my pancreas and so what we need to do if you introduce a foreign object into a body be

165
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:43,080
there in this case obviously a cell a biological cell your immune system has the propensity to

166
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:50,280
recognize that it's not natural it's not native to your body and it will attack them so you know if

167
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:57,399
you have a heart transplant a kidney transplant any kind of transplant where you're introducing a foreign

168
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:05,480
cell or a foreign article into your body we need to tap that immune system down to stop at attacking

169
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,560
the organ or in our case the cells that have been implanted so there's a fine balance there between

170
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:18,040
suppressing immune system to a point where it's not attacking the cells but it's still able to fight

171
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:25,080
off the bacteria and the viruses that I mentioned we know there is a ongoing science

172
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:33,879
where people are looking at coating these cells with various matrices so that they essentially become

173
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:40,680
invisible to your immune system other our company is looking at gene editing the cells so what's

174
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:47,480
again they become I'm using the word invisible but they are not recognized by the immune system

175
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,880
there was a company that recently put out a little bit of good data on these gene editing cells

176
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:01,720
being implanted but that's quite a way into the phara rising let's get into the clinical trials

177
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:11,720
so far so I know there there was that first study when was that conducted and what were the

178
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:19,320
qualifications for the patients who took part in it? I'm sure there were many but I kind of want to have

179
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:25,880
a good idea of who these people were. No problem so this study's actually been going on for a number of years

180
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:34,520
what's been rate limiting to the progress the cells that we are putting in the cell approach right now

181
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:43,480
the isle cells which are the cells that you how in your pancreas we are obtaining those from human donors

182
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:51,000
so these are kind of very cells and so we know we can control how many of those we can get access to

183
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,480
we're waiting for donors and not can we control the quality and consistency of those cells

184
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,800
so the study's been going on for a number of years now but we also signed a collaboration

185
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:13,000
with a company in Germany called Evil Tech and they are using induced pleuriportive stem cells

186
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:22,760
to manufacture human isle clusters so these are cells that are biologically made from stem cells

187
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:29,960
they differentiate into isle cells so that is a program that we have going on at the moment and our

188
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:39,240
hope and expectation is that next year in 2026 will be in the clinic with these stem cells so that

189
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:45,560
does a number of things for us you know we have then have an abundant supply of cells we know that

190
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:52,760
they are all consistent in quality and there is no limit to how many cells we can make so in power

191
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:59,720
of that we've been doing our trial and looking to optimize and understand how many cells we need to put in

192
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:06,200
these approaches depending on the on the on the on the weight of the patient principally and we've been

193
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:12,600
optimizing the immune suppression regime and we're making good progress and we are very

194
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:18,360
confident that next year we'll be in the clinic with these eyelet-like clusters managed

195
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:24,760
actually by Evil Tech so that's an exciting day that I'm looking forward to so I want to

196
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,920
let people know also you know a lot of people are going to listen to this and be like well when

197
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:35,800
how can I sign up I want to be part of these trials but I know that when you're when you're

198
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,360
taking on people for these clinical trials it's a very specific type of patient that you want to

199
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:46,919
bring on it's not your everyday person who's got a pretty good A1C and is managing pretty well right

200
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:53,240
like you need to be pretty specific who are these people that are part of these trials what what is

201
00:23:53,240 --> 00:24:00,120
their situation often like yeah so just in your your correct we we call it inclusion criteria

202
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:07,800
so we and the investigators and the trials specify what kind of patients are eligible to enter

203
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:14,040
into the trial and some of the things that I can disclose you know these patients have to be

204
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:24,840
over 18 years of age after have a body mass index that is reasonably in control and in range

205
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:33,480
but importantly they need to have demonstrated a history of severe hypoglycemia and

206
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:41,320
nocturnal hypoglycemia so these are pretty sick people however was fascinating you know people are

207
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:47,800
diligent a lot of the time a lot of the time they're absolutely not so we have a mix of people in the

208
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:56,680
trial some with high HBA1Cs which you know is a is a mechanism is a test for

209
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:03,320
seeing how well controlled your diabetes is over the last three months so we have some people who were in

210
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:11,480
the normal range which is less than 6.5% of the glycated hemoglobin and then there were patients that

211
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:19,640
were 10, 12, 13 which you will know that's a very very high number and what we saw in those trials

212
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:25,960
so the patients that had their A1Cs already controlled even though it's tremendous burden for

213
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:32,760
them to control the diabetes they have a controlled A1C over period of time this when they were on the

214
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:39,800
cell post therapy they maintained that good glycemic control but without having to do all of the

215
00:25:39,879 --> 00:25:45,399
million things that you and I have to do every day to control our blood sugar and then the people

216
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:53,560
that had high A1Cs in the 910 11 range those came down into the normal range so from 10 to

217
00:25:53,560 --> 00:26:01,480
below 6 to 6 and to put that into perspective because it doesn't sound like very much there are many

218
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:12,360
many studies showing that if you reduce your A1C by 1% you reduce the incidence of cardiovascular

219
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:22,040
problems, myocardial infarction by about 14%. So bringing that A1C is critical to the long term

220
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:27,800
control of cold morbidities associated with type 1 diabetes that a lot of people frankly forget about

221
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:37,560
these patients of with this study I know that there was one who became insulin independent for over

222
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:43,720
five years. Where's that patient now? How are they doing? Are they still insulin dependent?

223
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:51,320
Independent? How long has it been? What's what's going on with them? Yes so that was actually the first

224
00:26:51,320 --> 00:27:00,120
patient in the trial and this lady whose name I can't mention she became insulin independent

225
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,800
the beginning of the trial and she was still insulin independent after four and a half years.

226
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,960
Unfortunately and there were no additional surgeries, no additional transplants,

227
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:18,040
or implants of cells after four and a half years she developed another condition which meant

228
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:25,240
unrelated to what the study that we were conducting and she had to stop her immune suppression.

229
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:33,320
So that meant that she had to commit a trial so we had the opportunity then to retrieve the cell

230
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:43,960
pouches and we retrieved them and we showed that the cell pouches were at no fibrosis,

231
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:51,720
the structural integrity was a hundred percent intact and then we went on to do histological analysis

232
00:27:51,720 --> 00:28:00,520
of cell analysis of the eyelet cells in the pouches and we showed at abundance of fully functional cells

233
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:08,120
producing the three hormones that you need to control diabetes. So you know people when you

234
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,960
you talk about type one diabetes they said oh you just need insulin what's the problem?

235
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:20,200
But the normal person on the street the pancreas makes three hormones. So you have insulin that's

236
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:27,800
razor blood sugar down but in a normal pancreas you also decrease a hormone called glucone

237
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:34,840
which raises your blood sugar to prevent you going high pole glycemic which is as you know is

238
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:40,600
not a pleasant thing and is life threatening but then also a hormone called somatostatic that controls

239
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,840
insulin and glucocone and keeps your blood sugar in the normal range. So what we're doing here

240
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:53,480
we're not just providing patients with replacements of their insulin we're providing them with normal glycemic

241
00:28:53,560 --> 00:29:01,480
control associated with all three hormones that are secreted by pancreas. Okay and I know that

242
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:08,680
there were another what five or six patients that became insulin independent. What what's the status

243
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:16,520
of those patients? So some of them are still going on so they're still you know they're still being

244
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:22,120
monitored by the clinical trial site and still insulin independent and some of them had to stop

245
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:29,000
three before various reasons. Again let's be realistic here you know this is a an early stage

246
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:36,360
proof of concept clinical trial upon which we will build year on year until we get this approved.

247
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:45,080
How long are you going to monitor all of these patients? We monitor if they're still on the therapy we

248
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:51,320
monitor them all the time you know these patients they're still used continuously cosmeters

249
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:58,200
so they can see every every minute of everyday what the blood sugar is. In fact our

250
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:06,520
principal investigator he has the continuously cos graphs and charts on his phone as well. So these

251
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:13,080
people have been monitored very safe then we there are obviously safety measures in place for when you're

252
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:19,560
running a clinical trial and those we take those very seriously and we monitor these people all the time.

253
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:27,240
Okay and I know that some people failed with this treatment. What were you seeing there? What was

254
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,360
what did you come up with the reason as to why some people you know it wasn't taking for them?

255
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:42,919
Yeah so in the second part of this trial we call it cohort B. What we were trying to do was put more

256
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:53,320
cells in but also try to reach a immune suppression regime that is well tolerated these these

257
00:30:53,320 --> 00:31:01,080
regimes can be polluted by people but it gets to that level where we're not causing the immune system

258
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:08,920
to allow your immune sort of the immune suppressants allowing your immune system to attack the cells.

259
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:15,720
So you know in very late months term we've been turning knobs on the cooker head to try and

260
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,720
balance all of this out. So in some of those patients we have some of them ongoing that are insulin

261
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:27,960
independent in this second cohort and then we have others that failed and you know that's what we need to

262
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,320
know we need to know what works and we need to know what doesn't work so that when we move into the next

263
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:42,760
cohort we'll you know you take a big step forward each time you do these these trials.

264
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:49,639
Are you recruiting at all right now for for any trials or are you kind of working with what you have for now?

265
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:57,159
No okay yeah if you want to learn where this you know this contact information on our website

266
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:03,640
Feel free to send us an email yeah I'll put that I'll put a link to that in the show notes

267
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:12,680
Today's episode is sponsored by T1D Exchange you can directly make an impact on diabetes health care

268
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:20,040
treatments and technology by participating in the T1D Exchange registry it starts with the simple survey about your

269
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:26,040
life with T1D and it only takes about 15 minutes after that you'll have a personal portal with ongoing

270
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:31,879
T1D study and survey opportunities plus some of these studies even offer compensation

271

273
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:53,480
So let's talk about kind of what's next for Sernova you mentioned the stem cell derived

274
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:01,320
Islet cells can you kind of explain that to us a little more deeply as to why that will be helpful right like right now

275
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:10,280
You're relying on donations of cells right so this could be an opportunity to just mass produced is that what this is

276
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:20,440
It's a certainly mass production and but when you obtain a donor cell so unfortunately these

277
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,879
poor people are deceased and they are on the organ donor list and the pancreas and other organs are

278
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,399
retrieved and you know thank the law of four people willing to do this and so when the cells are

279
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,800
harvested from one to the best phrase they are not always the same

280
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:46,440
you know taking cells from a deceased organ and putting it into a healthy

281
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:54,680
human being it is miraculous and you know we've been able to achieve that and you know organ transplantation

282
00:33:54,680 --> 00:34:01,720
there's been able to achieve that but there are limitations on quantity as you said but also on quality

283
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:09,800
so deriving these Islet cells from stem cells allows us to address the quantity issue

284
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:17,800
because they're made in a in a GMP laboratory facility so you can make as many as as you like

285
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:26,520
and and they are all will be the same consistency and quality and the cells that we have so far we've

286
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:33,320
done them in pre clinical studies and they two produce insulin glucogram and somatic statin

287
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:42,520
and we've done some animal models where these animals are induced to be diabetic and of course

288
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:49,960
their blood sugar flies sky high and then you know they are the other recipients of transplants of these cells

289
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:58,680
and then that blood sugar comes into the normal range we see a very flat line just in a

290
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:04,360
unit I could show our curves and our phones now we we don't have flat lines but these high quality

291
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:11,560
highly functioning cells are in the normal range for the duration of the study and even when you give the

292
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:21,640
the animals a high glucose diet you know a high carbohydrate diet to see of the blood sugar spikes

293
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:31,880
it doesn't it stays controlled so it's the future and when we get there we can say we we had a functional

294
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:38,520
cure will it work for everybody who knows I don't know these stem cell derived Islet cells are these one

295
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:45,000
step toward the gene edited cells that you're working on that would that wouldn't require immunosuppressants

296
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:54,520
kind of are there some phases that you have to go on before you get to a cell that evades immunosystem

297
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:03,560
yes you're absolutely correct so the the stem cell derived Islet cells will be our first entry into the

298
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:11,160
into the marketplace if you like and then in power law we will continue to work on these gene edited cells

299
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:20,600
and then the expectations that one day the stem cells would be surpassed by the gene edited cells

300
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:26,360
well they're still stem cells but they edit the genes so that the the surface of the cells is it's not

301
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:34,600
recognizable by the by the immune system so that's the I'm not sure this is an appropriate phrase but

302
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:44,280
that would be the holy grail yeah what would you say is the big obstacle here the big obstacle is science

303
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:51,080
it takes a lot of time to validate the science scale up the manufacturing to make sure that everything is

304
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:57,960
at a very very high level of quality and that the cells are very very safe you have to prove that

305
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:06,360
in many many studies so it is a time under money candidly it just takes a long time to do this work

306
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:13,080
so um recently a company sent a biotechnology they put out research that their approach

307
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:20,680
for a cure doesn't require immunosuppressants what did you find interesting about their approach

308
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:29,400
I was fascinating um they implanted these cells into the four muscle of the patient with type one

309
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:37,880
diabetes and they monitored their insulin use and their glucose control over a month of a 28 days

310
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:46,920
and at the end of the 28 days they didn't see anything of safety concern and they did see

311
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:53,800
insulin independence so the patients was wasn't not needing to give themselves exogenous insulin

312
00:37:54,600 --> 00:38:01,640
so that's that's wonderful news but we also have to put it into some kind of perspective it was one

313
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:09,319
patient over 28 days so ultimately you're going to need data on many many patients for a long

314
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:18,359
long time so great news but it's very early is there some form of crowdsourcing of information

315
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:25,240
like you have Santa biotech coming out saying they did this you have vertex building a factory for

316
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:34,040
their derived stem cells I'm sure you're not trading super secret stuff but is there some form of

317
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:39,160
when you hear a company do something oh maybe that's a direction we kind of go into or or is there

318
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:45,800
some form of communication going on between these companies there is I mean there's definitely

319
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,080
communication and we communicate with people in the field they're interested in what we are doing

320
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:58,520
they're interested in what they're doing and you're all of these clinical trials particularly

321
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:05,960
in countries like the United States you have to get permission to do them by the US FDA the food and

322
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:12,920
drug administration so those drug applications the protocols for doing the trials they are public

323
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:21,720
so you can go on to pubmed.gov is called and you can read our clinical trial design you can read

324
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:27,560
vertex is clinical trial designs what kind of patients they're looking exactly how that that

325
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:34,920
I can do up to these studies and then there's an obligation when you get the data when you the trial

326
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:41,480
completes that you have to disclose the good the button the indifference and each trial especially

327
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:49,080
early there's good sometimes bad and indifference data so it's very very transparent what people are doing

328
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:56,040
and then people like to publish their their information and have peers review their information and

329
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:02,600
present them a conference is so it's a very transparent organization actually Jonathan thank you so much

330
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:08,839
for coming on the show I'm so glad that we got a deep dive on what Cernova's going on it's very unique

331
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:16,440
and I'm excited to see you know how it evolves I'm glad to hear that it won't affect people six packs so that's

332
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:23,560
great but yeah this was this was super enlightening it's great to hear that someone like you is working on it

333
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:29,160
is very close to the project and and I'm hopeful for for the future trials that you have going on

334
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:36,359
well thank you Justin and I I don't need our deserve any praise because I'm surrounded by

335
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:44,839
great teams great scientists people that curb it this and I'm just one of the one of the

336
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:51,560
little cogs and the big mechanical clock but thank you and again thank you for the exposure that you give

337
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:57,799
because it's important that people know that we are working on this it's important for people who

338
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:05,000
the reality I'm doing this it's not an easy task but look at Ryan there are many many diseases

339
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:12,520
that have been cured many many diseases were years ago we were also death sentences but the farmer

340
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:20,760
farmer and biotech industry are fixing them in a pretty rapid succession so all good what do you think

341
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,960
about Cernova's approach let me know in the comments on YouTube and what do you think of the landscape

342
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:31,240
of diabetes cures did you watch last weeks episode if you didn't you gotta check that out I'll throw

343
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,960
that in the show notes and if there are any cures out there that you want me to speak with someone from

344
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:42,200
that company I will do my best Cernova reached out to me I think and luckily we could get something down

345
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:48,440
but vertex I've been trying they're they're not they're not into it but maybe there are some other

346
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,560
companies so let me know who you want to hear from in the comments and if you aren't already subscribed to

347
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,400
our blog and newsletter I've got articles going up every week on there as well as a newsletter coming

348
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:06,120
out every other week on diabetic.behive.com there's a link to that in the show notes you can click that and you

349
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:11,720
can subscribe to our newsletter that way you know what is going on in diabetic content as well as the latest

350
