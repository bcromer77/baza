Huge news, the Dex Comstello continues glucose monitor now integrates with the ORA Ring Fitness Tracker.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,660
Stello is what Dex Comst calls a biosensor.

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,040
It measures glucose readings every 15 minutes and it has no alerts.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:23,920
The ORA Ring is a fitness tracker that measures a bunch of different biomarkers from stress, sleep, activity, heart rate, and a lot more.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,440
Now here's why this matters.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,920
There are over 42 factors as to why glucose levels fluctuate.

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,200
An integration like this could help us learn a lot about how daily activities affect us.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:45,440
The ORA app now has a glucose graph that not only shows glucose levels, but puts little markers showing whether it was stress or activity that may have affected us.

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,480
There's also a food tracking option where you can take pictures of your food and it will implement that into your glucose trends.

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,840
Here's the bad news.

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:07,360
Stello isn't for people with diabetes who use insulin in a way this roll out hurts because I feel like if anyone needs to understand glucose trends and why they're affected, it's people with diabetes using insulin.

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,280
But my hopes are that this is the start of something.

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:19,600
Now what are your thoughts on this? How do you feel about people who don't have diabetes wearing continuous glucose monitors and getting all of this information?

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,320
Let me know in the comments and if you want to learn more about this partnership and the integration,
