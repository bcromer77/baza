00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,400
Hey everyone, today I am going to show you how to record your screen on a Mac, and then I'm going to show you how to record your screen with audio, which is a little more difficult.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,880
So let's start with recording just the screen. It's a little easier. So the first thing you're going to do is you're going to open up a quick time player.

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,320
I'll let you open up apps by holding down command in the space bar, type in quick time.

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,320
There we go. And now you can see it's open up in the corner. I'm going to press cancel on that.

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,320
I'm going to go to file and then new screen recording.

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:47,320
It's really that simple. Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to click this record button and it's going to give me the option to either drag and click where I want to record or I can do the entire screen just by clicking the screen.

7
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:57,320
So I'm going to just for the purposes of showing you how to do this. I'm going to drag and get this area and then I will start recording that.

8
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,320
And then let me put up a video that I wanted to record.

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,319
There we go. This is the video I wanted.

10
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:12,320
Game recording. And I'm going to stop it now. I'll just hide it.

11
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,320
And then look there you go. I've got a recording. Screen recording. Pretty great.

12
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:26,320
Now that I have this video, I can save it by doing command S. And then I'm going to call it Justin VR.

13
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,320
And save it on my desktop.

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,320
Done. And saving. So this is really great. If you just want video recorded on your screen.

15
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,320
But if you want audio recorded with the video, it takes a few more steps.

16
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,320
But it can be done. And I'll show you right now.

17
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,320
So the first step you have to do is download sound flower.

18
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,320
I have a link in the description below. Download that.

19
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,320
What may happen when you open up that package, it tells you you don't have permission.

20
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,320
So the way to get around that is just go to system preferences.

21
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,320
And go to security and privacy. And you're going to have to unlock this just by putting in your code.

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,320
And then right over here, it should be asking you if you want to allow this to be installed on your computer.

23
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,320
And the answer is yes. Once that is installed on your computer, we have a few more steps.

24
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,320
You'll want to open up audio midi setup.

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,320
And right in here, you have to do two things. You're going to have to create both of these things that I have right here.

26
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,320
So to create this, you're going to click plus and then create aggregate device.

27
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:39,320
Once that's open, you'll have to check off the built in microphone and sound flower 2H, which is now there because we downloaded sound flower.

28
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:47,320
Then you're going to have to go to the plus sign again and create multi output device.

29
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,320
So click that and then I called mine screen record with audio.

30
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,320
And then click the built in output and sound flower 2H.

31
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,320
So basically these are going to act as a conduit between your recording and the audio output.

32
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,320
Okay, so we have two more steps and then we're done.

33
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,320
So now that you've done that, we can exit out of that.

34
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Next, you'll want to go to system preferences and then you're going to go to sound.

35
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Right now, you're sound should be coming out of internal speakers.

36
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:23,320
What you're going to want to do now is you're going to want to have the output set to screen record with audio or whatever you named it.

37
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:29,320
So click that. Good. Look at now we're ready to record the audio with the screen recording.

38
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:37,320
So let me open up quick time and cancel that again.

39
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,320
And I'm going to do new screen recording.

40
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,320
And this time you see this little drop down and I'm going to go to sound flower 2H.

41
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:52,320
Alright, so I'm ready for my screen recording with audio.

42
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Click record.

43
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,320
I'm going to do the same little area.

44
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Click start recording.

45
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,320
And then I'm going to put up my video again this time.

46
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,320
You should have audio.

47
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:16,320
Alright, so I'm recording it and pause it now.

48
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,320
And let's see. I'm going to stop recording.

49
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,320
And I'm going to change in order to hear it.

50
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:29,320
I'm going to have to change my system preferences back to the sound back to my internal speakers.

51
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:36,320
And then let's see if it works.

52
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,320
I see this is going to open up that box.

53
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,320
Yeah, did.

54
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
There is my audio.

55
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
First things first.

56
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
So there you guys have it.

57
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,320
