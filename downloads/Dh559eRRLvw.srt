1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
Justin, what are you wearing?

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,040
Oh, this is from a cos it's the women's section.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:04,840
You like the lavender?

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,480
No, I meant your diabetes type.

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,280
Oh, yeah, yeah, I've got an omnipot here with a lavender shell.

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,800
This is from Sugar Medical.

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,800
I freaking love this thing and it just comes right here

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,720
and pops right on, there's a bunch of colors.

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,160
And then I've got an adhesive patch here.

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,080
This is from skin grip.

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,280
It's also like a lavender.

12
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,560
So I'm having a bit of a lavender day with my diabetes tech.

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,120
And then I'm gonna head over there to the beach.

14
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,960
See ya.
