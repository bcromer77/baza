00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hey guys, come on in. I want to show you iOS 13 CarPlay.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh, well hello people. Welcome to my old Fusion. Today I wanted to show you iOS 13 CarPlay

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
because it's really cool they added some new features and most importantly they added multi-tasking.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But before I show you that why don't you subscribe to this channel.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm a growing channel and I would love your support.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Anyway, iOS 13, let's do it. CarPlay, huh?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I just connected my phone and this is CarPlay right here.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So a few things that they did here, first thing is they changed the now playing button.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Should be more of like a play button.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Which I guess it makes it less like iTunes Z.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So we got that. Now when we go on now playing this is my Spotify account, which I really like the way they designed the Spotify

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you're a playlist browsing and you're library.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So right here, this is the tab that will take you to your apps.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But if you slide to the right, it will bring up the multi-tasking.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So right here, I'm able to see my maps and I'm able to see what's playing.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Right now, nothing. So let me play a song.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's play the five run playlist and I'm going to turn off the music right now.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But now, when I go here, you can see that Billy Isle is playing.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And then I have Apple Maps and a couple routes that it's asked me if I want to do it.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So unfortunately, you can't switch out this main map in the multi-tasking section for Google Maps.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It has to be Apple Maps at the moment.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I hope in the future that this is something that you can change because I am not a fan of Apple Maps.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Google Maps all the way.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay, so I really do love the multi-tasking here.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let me put a destination in the map.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll put in my old work because it's not my home and you can't stop me.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And now that I have that, I can go back to the multi-tasking.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You can see my route right there and the music right there.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Also, when someone texts you, it's a little bit different.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So let me show you that actually what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the camera from you.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Brian, this is Brian.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Hi.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hi.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And text me.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, shit.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I have your phone.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Okay.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Text.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So watch what happens when Brian texts me.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
They moved where the text message comes, which I kind of like.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There it is.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So the text message comes there.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Also, one really great thing is when I press the Siri button on my car.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Siri no longer takes up the whole screen.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It is right in the bottom.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Which is really nice.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You can still see your directions.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Which was a super big flaw in the last version.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So yeah.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm pumped about that.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
All right.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let me give you this back.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
When did my text message say?

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Brian Hanson said.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Pock you.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Pock you.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Can you reply?

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh, we got something that I didn't say.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This is the best feature of all.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So let's say I have Google Maps open on my car play.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If my friend takes my phone now and they want to open up Spotify and change a song.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you use to have it as soon as they open that app, it would change on the dashboard.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Now that doesn't happen anymore.

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I will have Google Maps still on the screen while my friend opens up Spotify.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So you really only can change the apps on here from this screen.

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That is the hands down number one best feature of a iOS 13 car play.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And I'm super pumped about it.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So you should be too.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's all I've got on iOS 13 car play.

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Really excited about it.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It comes out in September.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I do have more iOS 13 videos coming out.

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So stay tuned for that.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Now you do that.

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Subscribe to this channel.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Which do it.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Also, why don't you like it if you like it.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Like it if you like it.

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It makes sense.

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's in the word.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Like is in the word.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Like.

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So.

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's.

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's me being smart.

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Anyway, I'm Justin.

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll take you later.

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But I think that's honestly.

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Back to be it.
